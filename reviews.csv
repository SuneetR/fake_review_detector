""This is an excellent review of many important topics of Astronomy. Some astronomy resources can be too elementary and suffer from lack of rigor, while some resources for astrophysics and cosmology can be poorly written (terrible explanations of topics) and very daunting. This Schaum‚Äôs Outline for Astronomy by Stacey Palen is well-written, with excellent and succinct explanations of sometimes difficult topics. Illustrations throughout the book support the concepts that are covered and the calculations are well-explained and accessible. Five stars. Definitely recommended for students of astronomy!"",1

To make matters worse, not all the earrings and necklaces displayed in the picture were included in the delivery, which feels like a total rip-off.

""This chopper by pigeon is one of the worst and most hopeless chopper available. I wasted my money completely. My sister bought a small size I bought 900ml both stopped working on the very first day. Since I had used a similar chopper from a different company I knew how to repair. I opened the top and saw that they have used a third class plastic material. Do not buy this chopper from Pigeon!!"",1
""The quality of the plastic is good and the chopepr does its job well, providds very finely chopped veggies but the only drawback is that after few uses, the string loses its winding capability, also there is no replacement option, just return option is available"",1

""I recently purchased the Nutri Pro Bullet Blender, and it has quickly become an essential part of my kitchen routine. The quality of this blender is top-notch. its made with durable materials that feel sturdy and well-constructed, ensuring it can handle daily use without any issues.Ease of use is another standout feature. The simple design makes it incredibly user-friendly, even for those who aren't very tech-savvy. Just twist, blend, and you're done! It‚Äôs also easy to clean, which is a big plus for anyone with a busy schedule.What really impressed me is how versatile this blender is. Whether I'm making smoothies, grinding nuts, or even preparing soups, the Nutri Pro handles it all with ease. The powerful motor ensures everything is blended to perfection, leaving no chunks behind.Overall, I highly recommend the Nutri Pro Bullet Blender to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality blender that is easy to use and delivers great results every time"",0
""The Nutri Pro Juicer, mixer blender is a very great product. It‚Äôs more than what I expected in the price range. It‚Äôs easy to put together, use, and clean. When there was issue that occurred, I raised a complaint, and the service team responded quickly. This appliance has become an integral part of our kitchen. I‚Äôve been using this product from preparing morning juice to lunch and dinner pur√©e preparations. It‚Äôs been 3 months since I‚Äôve been using Nutri pro and I am very satisfied with the product"",0
""I have ordered this product for my friend as a gift. She was happy with the product as it worked fine. Smoothies, chutneys, juices all can be made in it easily. However, the product stopped working within one and a half month. Thankfully, the customer service provided by them was quick and helpful. They immediately replaced the blender. It has been 15 days since replacement. Things are working fine now. Will update the status of this review again if it is not working. If I don't update it, just understand that I am happy with the product and it is working fine since then. However, the only thing I don't like about this product is the quality of small jar. I don't know why but the small jar has started becoming opaque instead of transparent, which it originally was. The quality of bigger jar and glass-like container is intact. And, it has been hardly 2 and half months since I brought the product"",1
""Quality is amazing. Been using this mostly for fruit juices since about 2 months now and it works great. Initially I thought the 1 min continuous running time limit would be a limitation but I never really needed even more than 30secs continuous use.I bought the 3 jar model, thought I'd get 3 grinder sets but one of the jar only got a sipper.The dry grinder also worked well to make masala.Would have given 5 stars if there was a multi speed setting.Overall a good buy. Definitely worth it"",1
""I've been using the ATOM Digital Kitchen Food Weighing Scale for a few weeks now, and its an absolute game-changer for my cooking and fitness routine. The scale is incredibly accurate, allowing me to measure ingredients to the gram, which is essential for both baking and maintaining a balanced diet. The sleek design fits perfectly in my kitchen, and its super easy to clean. The display is clear and easy to read, even when weighing in larger bowls or plates"",0
""Poor quality‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt start up on pressing. The batteries provided were puffed up and not fitting in the slot. Even new batteries found it difficult and didn‚Äôt start with new set of batteries"",1
""Given these features, I had high expectations for its performance. However, upon using the product, I encountered a major defect. The display often flickers and sometimes doesn't turn on at all, making it impossible to get any readings. When the display does work, the weight measurements are inconsistent and vary wildly even with the same object placed multiple times. I weighed the same item, only to receive different readings each time. This inconsistency renders the product useless for any serious measurement tasks.The plastic casing feels cheap and flimsy, and the buttons are not responsive. After only a few weeks of light use, the weighing platform has already started showing signs of wear and tear"",1
""I ordered the set because I previously had a similar one from another firm, a very useful thing in the kitchen. The box was crumpled, but the product itself was intact, instructions on the box. It looks good, I hope it will last a long time"",1
""The lights are quite good and bright. The quality of the string lights is commendable, perfect for both indoors and outdoors. The installation was pretty straightforward. The length is also quite generous allowing for flexible and creative decorating. The warm glow is perfect for creating a cozy ambience. Highly recommended"",1
""So far I have placed order üõí for festive lights üïØÔ∏è from 4 different brands/sellers. Destinct than the rest, the DesiDiya box is so beautiful üòç that it is Gift Worthy. Instead of gifting a box full of sweets (Soanpapdi üòÇ) to health/diabetes üç¨ conscious recipient, do consider this product as an option as well"",1
""Wast of money"",0
""The product looks amazing and fits perfectly. You get a tool inside the box for adjusting the strap length according to your convenience. The battery backup is good (but not 7 days as advertised, its like 3 to 4 days max. on average use). I don't use it for fitness tracking, so I won't say much about that, but it has a lot of those features though. Bluetooth calling is great, very good sound and mic quality for a watch. Overall, a 4 out of 5 for the watch.Now when it comes to the app associated with it, which is the NoiseFit app, it sucks a bit. I had continuous connectivity issues from the beginning. The initial setup somehow works fine, but once you get disconnected from Bluetooth, it is impossible to reconnect again (at least on my phone). The only way to reconnect is to unpair from the app (which also doesn't work), unpair the watch from your device settings, reset the watch, uninstall the app, again reinstall the app and start over everything again. Yes, that's what you have to do. And the customer service also sucks, why the hell do you need 3 WORKING DAYS to just respond to the complaint ticket? Even after responding they couldn't solve my issue for another 4 days. Then I just decided to give up on them and tried resetting my entire smartphone, and IT STILL DOESN'T GET SOLVED. So, I start over again and decided to never turn off Bluetooth. its been fine until now at least. Overall app and customer service rating, 2 out of 5"",1

It has good aroma and it smells for ling hours like more than 15 hours if you don‚Äôt sweat more.one important thing for me I would like to bring here is that it didn‚Äôt help me to reduce darkness of my underarms.

""Had been looking for grapefruit flavored soda for a while and came across Ice. Tasted great, so I started purchasing different flavors. Some are great, some are ok, and some I don‚Äôt care for. My go-to flavors are black cherry, black raspberry, grapefruit, and any of the lemonades/limeades. The new grape raspberry is on order and guessing I‚Äôll like it too. But why is ICE bottled in 17 oz containers when the rest of the beverage world uses 16 oz?"",1
""My husband loves these ice drinks. Doesn‚Äôt drink much diet soda but is diabetic, so he finds this a nice alternative to water or soda for a treat. His favorite flavors are cherry, black raspberry, kiwi strawberry, and cherry limeade. We buy about 3 cases a month from this seller. Cheaper here compared to the big box store. At the store, they‚Äôre at least $ 1 each, but normally $ 1.25, so this is a better buy. Plus, I get to skip a trip to the store and carrying heavy bags. But overall, much cheaper and convenient to buy the case."",1
""Ordered the same Sparkling Ice, which used to be green and had a less tart flavor. But did the company change both the color and flavor?"",1
""Liked this variety pack better than the last one. All flavors were acceptable, with Peach Nectarine and Pink Grapefruit being the best. Black Cherry and Coconut Pineapple were not as good as they sounded. Still waiting for the perfect combo."",1
""This variety pack has some tastier flavors of Sparkling Ice. My husband thinks anything with lemon tastes like janitor in a drum -> but the limeade is okay. My family likes it, and I‚Äôm fine with them drinking it in moderation. It has artificial colors, flavors, and sucralose. Also has vitamins and green tea extract, and the bottles are BPA-free. A bit of a mixed bag, but good in a household where we‚Äôre eliminating aspartame and trying to cut down on caffeine."",1
""This is their newest flavor and it‚Äôs fabulous. Not as sweet as ginger ale, but sweet enough with a delicate touch of lime. Perfect!"",1
""First adventure in taste titillation with this gift of a thirst-quenching, body-nourishing, energy-giving, refreshing, tasty, effervescent elixir. The formula was likely given to the company by space aliens who didn‚Äôt want Americans to suffer with overly sugary, caloric empty-calorie brown bubbly water. Sparkling Ice refreshments have 0 calories. The black cherry taste was tart and sweet but not overly sweet. Your taste buds adapt readily to the sucralose, and it becomes craveable! No caffeine, instead 50 mg of Green Tea, so your metabolism is humming away. More? B vitamins and D vitamins. Carbonation is just right!!! Though I love plain cold water, this is now one of my daily go-to liquid libations from top-secret aliens... :') Don‚Äôt let your lack of belief in aliens stop you from trying this fine product. I‚Äôm a Diet Coke nut, and this comes close to my love for Diet Coke while helping me stay hydrated and rev up my metabolism."",0
""Tried several flavors and like the Black Raspberry one best. Some are just OK, and some leave a bad carbon aftertaste. Everybody likes different flavors, so I won‚Äôt assume you‚Äôd like the same ones I do. The flavor is stronger than most flavored waters I‚Äôve tried, which I like because with most, you can barely taste any flavor. I‚Äôd prefer the berry tastes without the CO2, though. CO2 levels make me belch during and after finishing a bottle. There‚Äôs more CO2 than in sodas I drank. Good quantity of liquid in each bottle, so one bottle goes farther than a soda can but a bit less than a Gatorade bottle. Bottles are slim and tall with non-flat bases, so they easily tip over and spill. Needs a flatter bottom and should be shorter to hold the fluid without tipping over. More like a Gatorade 20 oz bottle. Several flavors have a strong aftertaste of carbon, probably from the CO2. Some flavors' carbon taste is more noticeable than others. Slight recommendation for taste and strong recommendation for healthiness as opposed to sodas. Advise new purchasers to buy a variety pack first, as judging by one flavor isn‚Äôt fair. Bought different flavors of these several times from Amazon and locally when stocked."",1
""Absolutely LOVE Sparkling ICE!!! Helps boost H2O consumption, gives me a little flavor, and, because I get several 'flavors,' adds variety to my day! I have to choose my flavors for my own 'variety' packs because everyone always puts strawberry something in there. While strawberries won‚Äôt kill me, they make my GI system extremely uncomfortable. ICE uses natural flavors, so I choose the ones without strawberry - Black Cherry, Cherry Limeade, Blueberry Pomegranate, Lemonade, Mango Orange, etc. All are delicious!!! My grandson even thinks they‚Äôre wonderful - he didn‚Äôt realize they were water until someone told him! This is the way to do it!"",1
""Sparkling Ice, Ginger Lime Sparkling Water, with antioxidants and vitamins, Zero Sugar, is a new flavor that‚Äôs both delicious and refreshing. Ginger and lime are among my favorite flavors, and it‚Äôs the perfect drink during hot summer months. Ginger is the predominant flavor with a good boost of lime, and it really hits the spot. The sparkling water is fortified with vitamins and antioxidants and has zero calories, so no guilt. Comes in a pack of 12 - 17 FL OZ Bottles and is easy to store. Each bottle contains two servings, but I must confess, I can polish off a whole bottle when really thirsty in this heat. Very pleased to have found this beverage and recommend it when you want something cold and tasty to drink. Give it a try."",1
""Absolutely love Ice water. Always been an avid Dr. Pepper drinker (as are many from the mid-South). its an Oklahoma/Texas thing to do and so unhealthy. Endocrinologist said I absolutely shouldn‚Äôt drink soda any longer due to the carbs. Told to try Perrier for carbonation, but that didn‚Äôt do it for me, so I just cheated, telling myself there are worse habits. A friend turned me on to Ice water but warned that she bought it by the crate at Sam‚Äôs and felt it was probably costly. She was right. Found it at Big Lots for $ .75 each, but it was burdensome to buy that way, and you could never be sure what was in stock. Then came the Pandemic. Dr. ordered me to stay home and have groceries delivered. Personally, I like the original flavors delivered here. Best price I‚Äôve found. I can count on them being delivered to my door, packaged neatly in a tight plastic wrap that fits perfectly in a box. Sometimes, due to carbonation, I worry about them spewing out like sodas often do. It starts to fizz up when I turn the top, but always goes back down. Amazing in this 100+¬∞ heat. Imagine the temps it reaches in those trucks. Grateful for this water, delivered safely to my door at a very reasonable price. Thank you."",1
""This stuff is crack. My boyfriend and I have tried every flavor of Sparkling Ice, and this Strawberry Watermelon flavor stands out. Been ordering three 12-packs a month for at least the past two and a half years and still not sick of it. It‚Äôs the only soda or sparkling drink we have. Balances both flavors well and is guilt-free. Relatively inexpensive, especially if you do Subscribe & Save as we do. Easily stack the 12-packs in a closet for a small footprint. Unrelated to the product, appreciate that all three arrive in one box that my poor postman lugs up a flight of stairs (don‚Äôt worry, I tip him each year)."",1

How HUGE is your face if these masks are too small? You must be a cartoon or some sort of animated caricature. These masks would fit Jay Leno‚Äôs chin! These masks would cover Adrian Brody‚Äôs big ol‚Äô honker! These masks would even fit OJ Simpson‚Äôs gargantuan noggin! Great buy, and I would buy again!"",0
""I‚Äôve been through about 6 masks now and I‚Äôve FINALLY found comfort and breathability. If I have to wear a mask, it‚Äôs got to be comfortable! I‚Äôm an essential worker in a warehouse but also am out and about quite a bit and I needed a reusable and washable safety mask. First of all, this mask is so soft, and secondly, it is 3 PLY which gives great protection as well...BUT the real value prop with this mask is the ear loops. The loops that come off this mask are circular and elastic and very comfortable. The previous masks I used had square-shaped elastic bands that went behind my ears which were incredibly uncomfortable and gave me Dumbo ears (not a good look). I also like that it‚Äôs a three-pack. I did purchase an XL because I have a beard and a larger face, it‚Äôs nice they have a size chart in their images and a few different sizes, this one is good you won‚Äôt be disappointed!"",1
""I like that these masks fit really comfortably on my face. I don‚Äôt feel like its squishing my nose, but it also has a decently tight fit. It also doesn‚Äôt pull on my ears like a previous one that I had. I know it isn‚Äôt the time to care about these things...but I looked seriously ridiculous with my ears poking out! They are made of really nice 3 PLY fabric, very happy with this."",1
""I have a pretty fat face, so I have trouble buying one-size-fits-all masks, but these fit very well. I can talk or open my mouth normally without it sliding off my nose or chin. The tapered nose fits well and doesn't leave a huge gap (I also have a honker of a nose). The fabric is soft and comfortable, doesn't feel suffocating. I washed in a lingerie bag on warm, and then tumble-dried on medium, and there was no shrinkage or damage. No unpleasant smell or feel. Would buy again."",1
""I have a big head and usually need an XL hat. These masks fit perfectly and feel very nice. Even if your head is a little smaller, these will fit fine and not kill your ears. Very recommended."",1
""These are the pictures of the extra large size. I hope this helps determine the correct size to order. The mask covers my nose and mouth perfectly. The elastic loops keep it snugly in place. The loops are not adjustable. The inside and outside fabrics are soft and lint-free."",1
""Bought these for my husband (pictured). We have been looking for something to fit his face. He said they have minimal fogging effect on his glasses. He‚Äôs happy with the product."",1
""Very flexible. The material is breathable enough that I don't feel like I am suffocating. The shape is also really good and it fits over my face very well. I definitely recommend washing them first thing, it helps them fit better and I found they can shrink a bit for a tighter fit on the face. They also are easy to pack up and take on the go, and I like the color. its very simple and sleek and is super useful."",1
""These masks are awesome and they are made really well... these will be great for when I go back to work or need to go to the grocery store."",1
""I just got the XL face masks in. They could still use to be a bit bigger. The nose section will come off when talking/yawning and the elastic is a bit of a stretch to get around your ears and feels quite thin. These are still going to hurt to wear for long stretches, but better than any other option that I've tried. If you have a big head/face, this is probably your best bet."",1
""Wow, the fit and quality of these masks are incredible. They are sturdy yet breathable and the fit is awesome... no more weird issues with masks falling down my nose when I talk. I love that they have anti-microbial properties too. Finally, someone got it right with this mask."",1
""I like that they have 3 different sizes. I ordered the large and it fits very comfortably without wanting to slide up or down my face while talking. They are made from a very soft material, and you can feel the 3 layers of fabric in it. The elastic loops for the ears are very stretchy and long enough that you don't get any pull on your ears."",1
""The masks are SO comfortable and breathable. They‚Äôre obviously not the same kind of protection as a surgical mask, but if you need one to run errands, it‚Äôs so perfect!"",1
""Great Product... Stretchy mask and thick protective mask...I will buy again."",1
""NOT Covid-19 Mask... These masks 'might' help with mowing or painting.. 'might'!! However, these are NOT for covid-19.. I should have read MORE!! The weave is too large in these, to be small enough for CV-19.. they have to be 0.3... These are just a 'for looks' mask! They are soft, comfortable, and breathable.. BUT the entire reason for purchase was CV-19... We will keep them; hubby will paint or mow with them!"",0

""I have looked at, purchased, and returned several masks (or given them away) because NOTHING ever fits right... These do, and they are pretty comfortable as well. The elastic is a little less stretchy, but I can put these on and talk without having to pull them up every 2 words. Covers everything that needs to be covered and stays put, thank you!"",1
""These masks are great. Excellent quality, leave you room to breathe and yet they are thick enough to protect you. I believe it could be a little thicker, actually, but it should do the trick. I am a 5.1 female and I got medium after reading a few reviews. I believe I could have gotten the small ones, as it feels a bit loose on my face. For reference, I have a thin, oval face and weigh 103 pounds."",1
""I purchased the small size for my 11-year-old and it fits perfectly. Not too tight that it‚Äôs pulling at the ears but definitely not leaving gaps. Material is thick but stretchy. For reference, she‚Äôs definitely on the small side, but overall, I think this could comfortably fit kids that are a little older."",1
""Alright, adult here with a teeny tiny head! Don‚Äôt laugh, but my favorite baseball hat is a 5T, so my head is NOT adult-sized. I ordered the small and it fits perfectly! I was desperately in need of a mask that I could wear during my CrossFit workouts and this wins! I don‚Äôt suck in cloth when working out and it stays put on my face without falling down or creeping up into my eye sockets. I ordered three more since I absolutely must wash them after each use. As soon as the white ones are back in stock I‚Äôll order 6 more for work!"",1
""It‚Äôs hard to believe that these are three-ply masks ‚Äî they‚Äôre very thin. Consequently, it‚Äôs hard to imagine that they offer much protection, particularly after they‚Äôve been washed a couple of times. I strongly discourage purchasing these."",0
""The colony has no smell, it has the smell of pure alcohol, it does not have any aroma. I feel cheated by the seller since the colony has no smell. It is not fair to be treated in this way, and I do not return it because it costs me more to send it back. The ideal is to replace it with a real cologne with a good smell."",1
""I've ordered this cologne off of Amazon a few times and I have never been disappointed. I know how it smells and how strong it's supposed to be. Unfortunately, this recent order was a rip-off. The cologne smells the same but is VERY faint. As soon as I spray it, a minute later I can't detect it. It takes a lot more sprays and the cologne is running out quickly. Amazon seriously needs to reconsider returning or at least refunding colognes. There are too many knockoffs/diluted products, and it is not fair for customers. If you can ship it to me, you can ship it back."",1
""I bought all three: The Classic, The Voyage, and The Blue. They all smell good. But in my personal preference, the King of all three is Voyage‚ÄîThe Nautica Voyage. It smells very fancy like a cool ocean, fresh but expensive elegant men‚Äôs perfume/cologne, all of the above in layers. For me, using it in 30 degrees February winter, it lasts a very long time (8-12+ hours, more if you use the right amount on you and some light spray on your clothes). You can also go light, and it will last 3-6 hours depending on how much you use. Then in second place is the Nautica Blue; it smells more sweet, like a hint of fruity sweetness, and fancy with tones of a cool and sporty fancy smell‚Äîvery, very nice. It lasts on me just the same length of time as the Voyage. And in third place, the Classic; it smells nice but it's too musky and woody for my personal taste, as I like it more sweet than woody, but it still smells really good. I can see some older, mature men liking this one better. But the really interesting thing is that when I mix and use equal amounts of both Voyage and Blue together, it creates a really incredible sweet, fruity, very fancy, and expensive fragrance that‚Äôs out of this world. It smells like cool oceanic sweet fruity sweet tones like peaches and cream with kind of pineapple hints, something really amazing to describe. I went to my daughter‚Äôs female doctor today, and she and also her assistant, who both entered at different times by themselves, mentioned the really amazing smell in the room, lol. Also, my teenage daughter mentioned how great my perfume smelled the day before. And another woman in the elevator said, 'Umm, it smells really good in here,' lol. So to me, it's a winner. Next time I will only buy the Nautica Voyage and the Nautica Blue‚Äîa perfect mix."",0
""Was looking for a clean/refreshing fragrance. While I thought about purchasing 'Invictus Aqua,' this was a very cheap alternative with great reviews. So I said, 'why not?'. To my surprise, it has a VERY clean, refreshing scent to it. When you wear this, you bring a wonderful crisp smell into the dull, scentless room! And yes, people notice it too. Received a compliment from a female co-worker the first day I wore it; she asked me what I was wearing. Like I said, it's a nice scent! Scent is A+. Projection lasts about 3-4 hours, afterwards being less strong but still noticeable up close. Total longevity is about 6 hours since it's a light fragrance, not too shabby. Totally recommend. If you don't like it, throw it in the corner. It's too affordable to not at least try first."",0
""Over the years I have tried several different office-use toilette sprays, and to my astonishment, most do not last the entire day. Yesterday, while working in the backyard expanding the HE SHED in Southern California (Inland Empire), I came in for an afternoon rest. The better half (the wife) mentioned if I was wearing cologne. She also said it smells nice and sweet. I was stunned. Why? Sweating and dusty from building materials, I did not expect it to last that long. Well...it not only met my wife's nose but continued the entire day. The cologne is not only a grand bargain (bang for the buck) but also appealing to those with a nose."",1
""I don't know if this is fake, or Nautica just made a poor product. This smells good initially, but the smell is weak and does not last more than 30 minutes. If I spray it in the morning, the scent is gone by the time I have my coffee. Not buying this again."",0
""It doesn't seem to be an original product. Not enough fragrance."",0
"‚ÄúGreat size and value for the price, light crisp airy scent, perfect for the summer, not sure if I would consider it to be a thick fall scent, but definitely fresh and crisp! Longevity has been pretty good; if you apply in the morning and go all day, it will pretty much last you all day. If you happen to be going out at night, apply a few more squirts and you're good to go!‚Äù",1

"‚ÄúFirst time purchasing a Nautica brand cologne. Had never smelled it before, but I had just run out of my normal everyday cologne. I was looking for something a little different and came across Voyage. It had tons of gleaming reviews and $ 15 for a 3.4oz bottle was a steal. The smell is very fresh, with hints of fruit and a light musky after smell. I really liked it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the longevity, in my experience, is only about 3 hours. After that, the cologne is hardly noticeable unless you literally have your face where you sprayed it earlier. But hey, for the price, that's to be expected.‚Äù",1
""I've bought tons of stuff from Amazon, including cologne. This is only my second review I'm making because this is one incredible deal. Been using different colognes and this one seems to get a lot of good reaction. I am a waiter so of course I like to smell nice, and this cologne has had guests genuinely laughing while telling me I smell so good. My coworkers have all complimented it to an extreme. Cool Water has always been my favorite, but people seem to really like this. I can say it's legit, but it doesn't last forever. I guess it peaks shortly after you put it on and lasts for roughly 5-6 hours before the smell starts to vanish. Overall, for the price... WOW. This cologne is a keeper in my collection as I don't like to wear the same every day. Side note- the bottle and cap are my favorite out of all the colognes I use, very nice job there. Awesome stuff."",1
""Nautica Voyage has a really fresh scent. I don‚Äôt really do the whole hints of this and notes of so and so. I'll simply stick to it has a fresh sort of out of the shower clean scent. Nothing is overpowering here; you can give yourself a few sprays and not worry about it suffocating the room. I will say as far as staying power, it holds up for a few hours. After that, it's pretty much non-existent. Really good for just an evening out or something but if you're looking for all-day, maybe not the best choice."",1
""I get this because I'm tired of paying a lot of $ $ $ $  for the expensive brands. Guess what? I've gotten more compliments off of this cologne in ALL my 54 years on the planet. Lol. I would recommend it every time. Let's just say it‚Äôs got a fruity, island, beach type smell. I think it‚Äôs awesome. I always read comments, and the people who have broken tops‚ÄîI can see it happening, but it hasn‚Äôt happened to me. But you know what, for the price YOU CANNOT BEAT IT. I‚Äôll take a broken top any day. They‚Äôre just the type that can‚Äôt find the good in anything. Find a cologne that‚Äôs less than $ 20 that‚Äôs that BIG OF A BOTTLE. You ain't gonna do it. It‚Äôs a great buy, and I‚Äôve bought it twice already. And I will buy it again. Thanks, Nautica. Awesome smell."",0

""I bought this for me and yes I am a woman. I used to buy Nautica Blue for my ex, and I loved it so much I ended up wearing it. When I went back to buy Nautica Blue, it was out of stock, so I settled for Voyage. I settled well. It is stronger than Blue, very masculine, yet breezy and cool and fits me just fine. I wear it daily to work and dab my little boy in it before heading out the house. He loves when I lift up the bottle to dab it on him, always smiles after. So even though it's for men, I find that it works well with women too... after all, I buy it for myself and I love floral scents."",1
""I didn't know what this smelled like before buying but I know Nautica to be a great brand. The only thing I was worried about was if it was going to be fake or something because that seems to be a problem with fragrances on Amazon. Well, after using it for the first time today... I'd say it's the real deal. I literally just did one little spray on my chest before I left for work. I could smell it just fine pretty much through the whole day. I actually can still smell it, and I have a very physical labor job (shipping industry), and I'd have to say that's pretty amazing. I'm glad I took the risk and would highly recommend this scent to anyone looking for an affordable cologne with a heavenly scent and long-lasting!"",0
""I purchased this cologne through Amazon and this is the first time I've tried this particular cologne as I usually go for The Beat by Burberry and this smells great. I put some on after receiving it this morning and now 12 hours later I still smell it on me. I spray a small squirt behind each ear and inside my shirt. You can go as subtle as you want with this if you choose or spray a little extra‚Äîeither way, it's gonna stick all day long. Very good price for such a good long-lasting smelling cologne. I have no idea why the 1-star reviews are complaining about receiving fake bottles unless purchased through a third party on here; even then, for as cheap as this cologne is to buy, it wouldn't make sense to imitate it. You normally see this happen on more expensive colognes. I have zero alcohol smell, and my bottle came completely sealed in plastic, and the bottle has the metal cap, not the plastic I‚Äôve seen some people talking about."",1
""I used to love this cologne a long time ago, but either the formula is different now or I received a counterfeit bottle. The smell does not smell the same and definitely doesn't last‚Äîit just smells watered down and has a fairly strong hint of alcohol. I'm not really sure what to make of that. I should note that the product I received was from 'Notre Dame de Paris Perfumes,' so it's 100% possible they just sold me a bunk knockoff. My mistake for not checking it more thoroughly. I've received legit colognes that were shipped and sold from Amazon themselves, so be sure to double-check who is selling the actual product. If you get the real deal, the cologne itself is a classic for daily wear in the summertime. You could do a lot worse for a $ 15 cologne."",1
""Not my bag, just too boring and typical. The sort of scent that is like 1000 others in the same price range and makes the ladies walk on by to the guy wearing any scent from Cerruti or Versace. I bought this in the search for a backup everyday scent. Thallium Blue is my starter and still the best, lowest priced men's fragrance one can buy in my humble opinion, if it jives with your body chemistry. I read reviews and had hopes that this might be the one to mix things up a little with the everyday scent, but nothing doing. It might be great for some and get some 5 stars, but I've bought men's fragrances online that had thousands of five-star reviews and smelled like an old lady's perfume. It's a gamble when you buy scent online with no way to check it out first. All you can do is give it a shot and don't spend too much money on anything you haven't checked out at a brick-and-mortar store and confirmed you like.

""Disappointed, where is the company getting this product from? I have been purchasing this product for years and I was able to notice the change of the scent, scent strength, and lasting. In the last 4 products I received, the fragrance is not strong enough as original products. As soon as it is applied to the skin, the aroma is thin and almost gone, in order to really smell the product you need to be really close to the body surface where you applied the cologne (it is like rubbing alcohol with some level of scent). I cannot state that it is FAKE because I am not an expert, but for sure it is not as good as products from other years. My wife was able to tell the difference really quickly and asked me if I changed the type of cologne because for her it was a different product. I confirmed the product differences in the dedicated stores where the 'same' product is available. Value is not the same as products from years ago, I have to use tons of the product to have the same level of scent from me. For my wife, maybe I will need to go and buy it in another place."",0
""Great fragrance but you must spray a ton of it to really project the scent and make it last more than an hour. I‚Äôd suggest keeping a travel-sized atomizer with you throughout the day to refresh the scent. Update: it is now my favorite summer scent! Where I thought it died out at the end of the day, I was wrong. My wife still smells it as I walk past. I bumped my review to 4 stars from 3 because it‚Äôs my favorite and lasts a long time. But you still need to put a lot on. One spritz on all the vital spots like wrists, inner elbows, collarbone, neck, and sometimes a few extra to really set it in stone. The smell is like fresh-cut watermelon mixed with fresh-cut grass. And those two scents are the best smells in the world to me. So if you love those, you will love this!"",1
""I am not too sure what I was sent. Packaging looks legitimate and so does the product. However, the smell of the product is nothing like the authentic cologne. I still have a bit of my authentic spray and my family can smell it from across the room when I spray it even once. However, with the product I received, I can't even smell it and I'm the one wearing it. The scent doesn't stay with you that long. You'll have to carry the bottle with you and keep spraying it on for people to notice you are wearing it if you are going to be out long. It does smell wonderful at first. I actually wondered if I was just getting used to the smell and asked my wife if she could even smell it on me. She had to almost put her nose on my arm to smell it. This will be my one and only time buying Nautica Voyage. I'd love to return it if I can"",1
""I don't understand why some people complained about this cologne...it smells amazing and it lasts forever. My fiance put it on at 8 am for church and by 9 pm it still smelled awesome. Of course, the smell of cologne or perfume will fade a bit throughout the day, that is understandable. But this cologne still smells awesome after hours! And the bottle is a big bottle and it does not look cheap or fake. Smell Description: it's not too strong but not too light it has a fresh sport smell kinda like Polo Sport or Axe Sport. It is not a musky smell or smells like something a grandpa would wear. It's something a crisp, sporty, refreshing smell...something like when you smell it you have to ask the person what they are wearing. My finance loves it and I love it more lol! And the bottle is the size of a large bottle of cologne, definitely looks like it's way more than what it costs"",1

""I always loved Michelle Obama.  Her grace and dignity always seemed to come as a gift from above.  Her spirit is so incredibly deep and strong.  The stories from her childhood, her brother, her neighborhood, her family, inform us in a brilliant voice about what it was like in the place and time she grew up. Michelle Obama has the empathy and the depth of character so missing in her media portrayal.  I always felt worried that we were suffocating her.  But there is a Michelle Obama who is bigger than the words on a page.  She knows our pains, and she understands our lives.  And we know her in this book.  In this most private book, we know her in a way we could not have otherwise.  Interesting that nothing here surprises me, it only affirms what I felt like I know:  Michelle Obama is a person like us.  She worked and suffered and overcame. Her storytelling skills are exquisite. It left me a little breathless to hear her voice, unfettered and real. I love the photographs."",0

It is a wonderful, heartfelt, true story of HOPE in a world gone far too cynical."",1

""I've always been an Independent Voter. I have no bias against Michelle Obama or negativism to say about her role as First Lady. However, I found her book to be grossly arrogant in its content and attempts at self-promotion...the very opposite portrayal of her wish to identify with, 'us ordinary women,' that she tries so hard to convey to her readers. Her latest appearance and comments on 'The Jimmy Fallon Show,' about sending the current First Lady a 'Bye Felicia' wish, was very telling about her lack of truthfulness in her book about always choosing 'to go high,' when she communicates messages to other disagreeing Americans. It was a rude and undignified comment, and I was embarrassed for her. She slipped at that very moment, and the world saw the truth behind the curtain of what type of woman she truthfully is in reality. She owes the current First Lady an apology. I will not recommend this book because of its untruthful representation."",1
""This is a book that is difficult to resist; the writing is sublime. Michelle Obama has a way with words; this is one of the most fascinating and informative books I have read this year. There is a great deal to admire about Michelle Obama. A young woman brought up on the other side of the tracks in Chicago, went to Princeton, and then Harvard for her law degree, and became the First Lady of the United States. Some of her success was due to luck, but most is due to her intelligence and her hard work. As a woman and a Black woman, she had to work three times as hard as a man, and she proved her worth. Michelle Obama tells us she is writing this book to inspire the next generation. She knows how important role models are, especially for young women of color in a culture that isn‚Äôt changing fast enough. She says in her book, 'Here I am, I have got a lot to say.' Her book is divided into three sections: 'Becoming Me,' 'Becoming Us,' and 'Becoming More.' What we find in these pages is a woman opening herself and her world to us. This is a book so well written, with such honesty and integrity, I felt like I was trusted with her secrets. She starts by talking about her upbringing, her life in Chicago, a family who showed such love and at the same time showed her that using her intellect to move herself forward was the right path. Off to Princeton where she was a minority for the first time, learning to navigate in a white world. Then to Harvard to study law and her first job, where she met her future husband, Barack Obama. Then the life of a married woman, working full-time, wanting a family and finally succeeding via in vitro fertilization. Her husband was into politics and was often not home, so Michelle was the parent. Some resentment and couples therapy helped them through their rough spots. Political life is difficult, and the statements by some were hurtful, and she names names. The scrutiny and constraints were a lesson she quickly learned and went on to become one of the most beloved First Ladies. Now, Michelle Obama has her real life back, and she is discovering who she wants to be. Malia and Sasha are settling into their lives with plans of their own. Michelle Obama has no love for politics and she will never seek a political office. Michelle, Barack, and the girls are looking toward the future. Michelle Obama is telling the truth of her life; she grew up surrounded by love in a city, Chicago, she loves, onward to an education that took her far. She has everything she wanted, family, a husband she loves, and now she is looking at her next adventure. An autobiography I urge everyone to read. This is a book of the year."",0
""Inspirational and powerful. I loved this book."",1
""This is an interesting, beautifully written book by one of the most admired women in the world. It includes many personal details about Mrs. Obama's background that were new to me and enjoyable to read. The photo section is a highlight. Michelle Obama, thank you for being such a great role model during your time in the White House, advocating for exercise and good nutrition for children, and speaking with grace and courage. We miss you."",1
""I did not enjoy this book. It came across as having a very inflated sense of self. I picked it up from my local library, attracted by its prominent display, but found it rather dull and self-congratulatory. The narrative felt repetitive, and I struggled to stay engaged."",1
""Michelle Obama's rags-to-riches story is gripping and worth reading. The book chronicles her journey from a government housing project in Chicago to the White House, showing her resilience and compassion. It‚Äôs a testament to her character and the impact of her work. The book inspires readers to find their voice and believe in themselves. Her honest reflections on race and her candid portrayal of the Obamas' time in the White House add depth to her story. It‚Äôs a heartfelt and sincere account."",0

"‚ÄúAmazing!!!!‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúI thought she did a really good job of showing us the human side of who she and Barack were. If a buddy of yours grew up to become the president or first spouse, and it was sort of a fairy tale, a book like this would show the underside or the real side of the process. Just like *Hillbilly Elegy* by J.D. Vance, this book shows us how some Americans 'make it' from the ground up, but that it‚Äôs not easy. Making it is a quicksilver process, requiring such ingredients as intelligence, timing, hard work, luck, and happenstance. It‚Äôs scary how many things can impede the chances of good, smart kids. Michelle Obama chronicles how she managed to make it, and she deserved her good fortune, but she would be the first to tell you a lot of it wasn‚Äôt up to her. This makes you sad about all the kids left behind, or let‚Äôs be honest: all the kids who are murdered before they can fulfill their potential. Obama is frank with kids who‚Äôre struggling against the odds, and in this as in so many other issues, she doesn‚Äôt get down and helpless over the burdens. She encourages us to accept what is and work around it. I found that empowering. Her description of meeting and getting to know, then falling in love with, Barack is really interesting. It was NOT love at first sight! They became friends, then sweethearts, and then, over time, deeply in love. We get to see what Barack is like‚Äîtruly, that‚Äôs the stellar aspect of this book; it‚Äôs so candid! Michelle isn‚Äôt afraid to complain and speak honestly; she struggles as a young adult and a working mother, then as a political spouse. You really see the sausage-works of political campaigns. The book wasn‚Äôt gripping, but it was interesting. I‚Äôve always thought she was super-smart and clever, and that seems true, but when she mentions she‚Äôs not overly introspective, I found that hard to believe. However, by the end of the book, I wondered if it was true because she minimized some events in her life that would have been compelling had she gone deeper. She was the first/only black woman to do X, Y, and Z. I feel quite sure she ran into a lot more obstacles than she shares, and in that sense, she kind of minimizes her astronomical climb. How many kids from the hood get into Princeton and Harvard, and then succeed as well as she did? And when she got hired at the white-shoe law firm, what did that really feel like? Ah, well. A missed opportunity. There is so much to like about this book, the little vignettes about life in the White House, for example. The policy issues were less interesting; the human issues more so. All in all, a worthwhile and enjoyable read.‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúNever have I ever wished I was illiterate until now. I have read some awful books in my day, but this one takes the cake by far. I will admit, however, I do have a favorite part of this terrible dive into the life of former First Lady Michelle Obama (mad respect by the way; love women, hate terrible books that make me want to rip my eyes out), and that is when I was able to close the back cover and toss this waste of a tree into a dumpster behind a local Long John Silver's. I would have returned this book and asked for a complete refund, but all the silver in the world couldn't give me back the time I wasted reading this tasteless piece of garbage. I support reading!‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúFirst of all, I‚Äôm happy to report that I‚Äôm writing this review AFTER I read the book, and it‚Äôs not completely based on my past and present political views. With that being said, I didn‚Äôt completely love the book. I was expecting Michelle Obama to be a little less guarded in it and go a little deeper into her personal thoughts and struggles; to be a little bit more candid. I also wanted to find out more about life in the White House. On all of those fronts, this book mostly doesn‚Äôt deliver. Mrs. Obama is an incredibly intelligent woman, and on top of that, she is a lawyer with an Ivy League education. That background has largely influenced this book, which feels like it‚Äôs been edited for any possibility of risky statements or disclosures. It feels too safe, too guarded to really be authentic. She focuses a lot on presenting a very clean version of her life (her family was perfect; it was loving and supportive, her mom was without any faults, her father was equally perfect and he handled his disability with pride and no complaints). Is that realistic? While her family must‚Äôve been quite amazing, and I‚Äôm sure she loved it very much, nothing and no one is really perfect. I just couldn‚Äôt buy it. For some reason, she barely mentions Harvard. She goes into quite a bit of detail about being a black woman at Princeton, but she dedicates maybe half a page in the book to her time at Harvard, mostly talking about how she didn‚Äôt have time to reflect on what she wanted to do in life during the intense studies to obtain her law degree. That‚Äôs it. It made me very curious about what happened at Harvard and why she or Harvard itself didn‚Äôt want that to be in the book. She is clear about not liking politics and not really wanting to be in politics, but provides very little insight into how she transformed from that stage to seeming to really enjoy being the First Lady (she was terrified Barack Obama wouldn‚Äôt be elected for the second term). She mentions very little about her marital struggles. She does say at some point they went to counseling, but again, it‚Äôs a brief mention and ends at that. She seems to describe nothing but marital bliss after that. I did appreciate that she mentioned having a miscarriage, having to go through IVF to conceive, failing her bar exam on the first try, and getting into Harvard from a waiting list. But I did notice one thing about the tone of the book: Michelle Obama is determined not to focus on anything negative. She mentions her miscarriage very briefly and almost dismissively by saying that they‚Äôre very common and happen to more women than we all think. That again takes about half a page to a full page. Her IVF is mentioned, but again quite briefly. She describes her life almost with a sense of distance at times, focusing on events not feelings or emotions. There were a few passages of the book that felt more personal, and I enjoyed them. The part where she says she skipped the final ball of the inauguration night (the one she was most looking forward to) because she was simply too exhausted to go. There is a part where she writes about Sasha thinking that nobody came to see Barack Obama‚Äôs acceptance speech the night of the first election because the streets were empty, and that in that moment she realized that they were empty because now they were traveling with the President Elect. She describes how it felt to see for the first time the heavy security surrounding her husband when he became president with the massive helicopters, motorcade, snipers, secret agents, etc. That gave me goosebumps. I enjoyed reading about that tender moment when Malia got an ear infection on vacation in Hawaii and when Barack Obama had to choose between leaving her and Michelle alone to travel back home to cast an important vote in the Senate or staying with his family (which did need him). I was disappointed that she didn‚Äôt write about how life has been after leaving the White House. Yes, there is that one toast she made, but other than that, it‚Äôs mostly undisclosed in the book. Do they miss it? Do they get to enjoy their lives now more? What‚Äôs next for them (other than creating a foundation in Chicago)? The book doesn‚Äôt talk about that. In summary, I do recommend the book. Michelle Obama is a good writer, and she is likable. She writes about race, family life, being a working mother, friendships, and politics. It‚Äôs still an interesting read, if not a little bit too safe.‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúOrdered this product directly from Technology LK before realizing that the same company also sells it through Amazon for a lower price. This backer rod is virtually identical to Frost King 'Poly Foam Caulk Saver' sold by Lowe's and other chains, except this is called Backer Rod and is 3/4' in diameter (actually, it's a bit less than 3/4'). 100' of this stuff weighs about as much as a box of feathers. The quality is typical of similar products (e.g., the Frost King), and it works fine for its intended purpose. My only complaint is that it came loosely rolled in a cardboard box instead of the obviously more convenient spool shown in the Amazon photo. Technology LK's website has the same Amazon photo for this product. See Customer Images. Two stars off for the deceptive photo.‚Äù",0
""The 1925 COBRA was among Valentino's last films--and it tends to divide the star's fans, who either rejoice at his appearance in a realistic drama or yearn for something that rivals his earlier, often outrageous seductive melodramas. The story concerns Count Rodrigo Torriani (Valentino), an impoverished Italian nobleman with a penchant for torrid affairs that lead to endless and often monetary difficulties. Largely in order to escape such difficulties, Rodrigo agrees to work for American antiques dealer Jack Dorning (Casson Ferguson)--only to find himself little better off in New York, where he wavers between office secretary Mary Drake (Gertrude Olmstead) and Jack's femme fatale wife Elise (Nita Naldi.) In a stylistic sense, COBRA shows what Valentino could do as an actor when he was not encumbered by the usual 'great seducer' scripts pressed upon him--and he acquits himself very well. The supporting cast, most particularly Naldi, is also excellent. But there is no two ways about it: COBRA is so low-key that it feels excessively slow as it moves toward its none-too-surprising conclusion. The film itself is beautiful to the eye. Valentino is very close to the height of his physical appeal and Naldi is stunningly beautiful in a series of Adrian-designed gowns; the art direction by William Cameron Menzies is excellent, and the cinematography by Fischbeck and Jennings has a velvety quality that is quite fine. Even so, and with a running time of just over an hour, COBRA feels excessively languid in tone. The DVD offers a handsome transfer and good music score, but little else. Recommended--but primarily for hardcore Valentino fans."",1
""Duofold makes an exceptional double layered thermal undershirt with a crew cut neck for incredibly cold weather. I got this not too long ago; and this particular undershirt is probably the best one I have when I want to use it as a layer of clothing to protect myself from the cold. I am also extremely impressed that it was designed to help protect U.S. Special Forces--now you KNOW it's going to help you stay warm in cold weather! This can be worn as underwear under your outdoor clothes or you can wear it in bed with thermal pajamas on over it. It does have odor resistant properties. Moreover, the fabric doesn't bunch up very much so it remains pretty comfortable while you're wearing it. This will last years with the proper care. I put mine in the regular clothes washer and dryer and it comes out fine. Note that this only comes in black; if you're concerned about the black color 'bleeding' onto other articles of clothing, wash this with garments that are not white. In addition, it shrinks very little. If you want to order this here, check the pricing and availability chart and the merchant sizing chart before you order. Overall, Duofold makes an awesome 'expedition weight two-layer thermal tagless crew' neck styled undershirt. I highly recommend it for when the temperature drops and you need to stay warm!"",0
""I wanted to like this sleek router and I paid extra for the N capability as I wanted to improve my connection strength and speed. Unfortunately, this works no better than my G router; in fact, it keeps disconnecting me from the internet for no reason at all, and even when it works, the signal strength keeps fluctuating and the 'Connected' box keeps popping up every few minutes, making it extremely annoying. In fact, the signal strength is actually poorer in some spots where it used to be good. It also does not support VPN connections and results in a lot of dropouts. I also use a Vonage VOIP phone over my cable internet connection which is connected to this router. I was expecting some voice quality improvement too after installing this router, but there is no improvement at all. In fact, since the connection keeps getting dropped, people keep thinking I'm hanging up on them, which is not good at all! However, on the pro side, the setup of this router was super-easy and took no effort on my part. All I did was pop in the CD and then followed the simple directions and 10 minutes later the router was installed. I find the design very sleek, but the blue icons on the front panel are very brightly lit and very distracting at night unless covered with something. Overall, I am quite disappointed with the performance of this router and I'm going to send it back and go back to my older G-router."",1
""I love my cats. I'd love them even more, however, if they didn't shed. But, since that's not a possibility, this is the next best solution. The rubber tips on the vac are fantastic for picking up cat hair (and I imagine dog hair as well) from furniture, carpeted stairs, or any other fabric. Unlike the powered heads, this does not have a spinning roller bar. You'd think that would be a disadvantage, but it is not - in fact, it works much better than a powered head. The rubber flexes to get into all the places where hair hides. More importantly, there is no risk of damage to fabrics. Power heads can snag on threads, and can really damage throws and blankets (especially anything made of yarn). The Bissell, however, just gets the hair out! It's bagless so no cost for replacement bags. Easy to empty, but the collection chamber is small - you have to empty it fairly often. Bissell also makes just the rubber attachment that you can use on their vacs or, with an adapter, pretty much any upright or canister vac. I have one of those as well (use it with the Bissell Healthy Home upright, which is another good product), but this vac is great when you don't want to break out the big vacuum for a small job. Also perfect for stairs since you don't have to lug a big vac, or pull a long hose. One of these should come with every cat adoption at the Humane Society! Top notch product."",0
"It is very rare that we can get to pick all three - as in this case. I purchased this item (Transcend M5 Multi Card Reader) because I need to read/write high-capacity SDHC cards, and my old card reader (Lexar Media RW022-001) is unable to recognize them. So far, I have tested the Transcend M5 with many different brands of CF and SD/SDHC cards, and it worked flawlessly. Just for fun",I also benchmarked several CF and SD cards in both my new Transcend M5 and old Lexar reader. I'm surprised to find out that the card reader actually makes a big difference in the data transfer rate.
"For example: when I benchmarked the SanDisk 2GB Ultra II CF Card in my old Lexar reader, I received a rather disappointing write speed of 4.1MB/S (equivalent to '27x'). But the same card in the new Transcend M5 gave me a write speed of 5.9MB/S (equivalent to '40x'). That's nearly 50% faster data transfer rate! Other CF and SD cards tested also showed similar performance boosts. (Note that Sandisk claims the Ultra II CF is capable of 15MB/S, but that's the maximum speed under optimal test condition.) In summary, the Transcend M5 card reader is very inexpensive, gives a much faster data rate than my old card reader, and seems to be very well-constructed. That makes it an excellent buy in my book.",0
""This package includes four rechargeable NiMH batteries (2x AA + 2x AAA) plus a simple charger. The batteries are the new Rayovac 'Hybrid', which are advertised to have a very low self-discharge rate similar to the better-known Sanyo Eneloop. The capacity of the Hybrid AA cell is rated at 2100mAh, slightly higher than that for the Eneloop (2000mAh). I have tested both brands and can confirm that their ratings are accurate. The Hybrid AAA cells, however, were tested to be slightly lower than the rated 800mAh capacity. In my 5-month self-discharge test, Sanyo Eneloop retained about 85% capacity, while Hybrid kept about 80%. For all practical applications, the two brands are equally good. So the Rayovac Hybrid could be a better value - if you can find it at a lower price than Eneloop. The charger included in this package, however, is a piece of junk. It is a timer-based dumb charger that simply charges for 8 hours at around 350mA and then turns off (obviously it was designed to charge 2500-2700mAh cells, because 350*8=2800). It also forces you to charge cells in pairs. Both 'features' are bad for your batteries. The charger included in the Sanyo Eneloop package is 'smart', in the sense that it charges each cell independently, and stops when each cell is full. If you are looking for a travel charger that is smart, compact, and reasonably fast, I highly recommend the KODAK K6200."",0
""These headphones are pretty damn good for the money! It's just as good--if not better--than most of the competitors producing in-ear headphones that cost more than 5-10x as much.

""These earbuds will change the way you look at this brand. I've always thought most of the stuff this brand made was kind of cheap, and looking at these earbuds and their price, it was hard not to think the same about them as well. But, even being a really big skeptic of them, even after reading review after review on these earbuds of how amazing they were, I ordered a pair to make my own decision about how good they actually were. After getting them, I quickly followed the advice of one of the reviews I had read and found the right size ear pads that go over the earbuds to make sure I had the best fit possible with them. After listening to them for a week straight--7-8 hours a day and with different kinds of music: rock, r&b, trance, etc.--to make sure they were getting a full-rounded break-in period, they became music to my ears! The lows, mids, and highs were exactly what I was looking for so long in some earbuds! I couldn't believe my ears! These earbuds really did deliver! I've tried Audio Technica's earbuds with some people claiming they sounded as good as the ATH-M50x's (which is a pretty big claim), only to find out that the reviewer was wrong; they weren't even close to how good the ATH-M50x's sounded. They lacked bass and the highs were ear-piercing! With this brand's it was all there and well-balanced, and they get better and better the more I use them. If you're looking for a good pair of earbuds, don't pass these up. You can't beat what you get for what a small price you pay for these earbuds."",0

Allows you to keep your belt on when going through airport security. A money belt that nobody would suspect. Holds lots of paper notes if carefully folded, and adjusts easily to waist size. A must for secure travel. Exactly what it says, nice belt with no metal and a zipper on the inside. Holds and hides money or small pieces of papers very well. Good for traveling outside of the country."",0
""This light might look crazy but it's a BEAST when it comes to output. So this headlamp is bright. I plan on getting lots of use out of this headlamp. Included is the headlamp, USB charging cable, wall charging adapter, and the headlamp itself (with rechargeable battery). There are four modes of operations. First is the center light, second is the outer lights, third is all lights, and the fourth is a strobe light mode with all lights turned on. The strap is adjustable and very comfortable. I was concerned about the weight of the large light on the front and the battery pack on the back. However, it is very evenly weighted so it ended up not being too heavy at all. The light is very bright and you can change the zoom of the center light to be highly focused or widely spread out. The outer lights can change focus just very slightly. This is my overall opinion: Pros: 5 Bright lights, Fast charge, Long lasting up to 3-7 hours under full charge, Shines really far, Hands free, Convenient, Great rotation, For so many different uses, Rechargeable batteries, Different levels of brightness, Has strobe, Zoom in and out, Fits nice, Sturdy and seems durable, Lightweight. Cons: None that I can find. Overall 5 of 5 stars, would definitely recommend."",0
""This knee pillow is very comfortable. I like it much better than trying to use a regular pillow. The regular pillow doesn't stay in place and is not as comfortable. This has helped me with back pain. The pillow fabric covering is very soft. The elastic band keeps the pillow in place. I will recommend this to my friends."",0
""When I ordered the Solar Path Lights for outdoor use I had no idea how beautiful they would be. They arrived in record time, no damage to the exterior or interior boxes. The lights already had been charged with solar energy. All I had to do was assemble them, which was extremely easy. First, I twisted the back of the light, the back came off, I switched the switch to on, reconnected the back to the light, put 2 rods together, connected the light to the rod (holder), and placed the solar-powered lights into the ground. As soon as evening set in, the solar-powered lights came on! The lights fade from one color to another, going from dim to a very pretty crystal-like brighter shine, adding a sweet glow to the garden. My pictures do not show the actual beauty or reflection of these sweet Solar Path Outdoor Lights! A must have!"",0
""This product is brilliant. The way it writes is so smooth that I can honestly say I cannot live without it. It also keeps children occupied for hours at a time without wasting ink or crayons. I tend to need to write everything down and got tired of seeing post-its everywhere. There is an easy delete button so when it gets full or you want to change the thing you just wrote, it's as easy as hitting that button and the screen goes blank. It comes with a convenient carry soft case for protection while traveling or storing and it's the perfect size for the kid. This tablet had a choice of many colors! It also came with a pen and sleeve to carry it in. The pen attaches to the bottom on the tablet so it will not be misplaced. We also received a magnet to place on the back of the tablet, just in case I wanted to hang it on the fridge or something metallic. I love that the entire screen's worth of writing can be erased instantly with the single press of a button. For usage scenarios like my grocery list, it eliminates the hassle of throwing out the previous list and starting over or having to erase things on a whiteboard. It's a very handy feature and a definite time saver. The device operates on batteries in order to use the delete button, it's made from good quality eco-friendly material and looks very posh when someone asks for some paper to write something on temporarily, the writing pen works very well with the pad. The parcel arrived the next day (via Prime) and the packaging was incredibly secure - no chance of damage in transit. Great value for money, especially for a supplier. I highly recommend both the product and the company."",1
""This mirror came securely packaged in the plastic air-filled wrapping to give it maximum protection during transit. The mirror arrived as expected. First of all, I would like to say that this mirror is purchased for my wife, for whom I'm writing this review. This mirror is perfect. I have been wanting one of these for so long and I'm glad to now have one. It has folding doors, one on each side. You will see on the left side you are able to magnify X2 and 3x for things like plucking eyebrows or specific eyeshadow designs. Also comes with a small 10x magnifying mirror which can stick anywhere using suction pods. On the front is the on/off switch and then once you open the two doors you will see a simple touch button to turn the light on. My room doesn't get a ton of light so this mirror has been such a useful tool. You can see as displayed in the pictures you can turn the mirror upward as you need to. Sometimes I stand to do some things makeup wise so this is really a cool option to me. You will receive a USB style cable which you can use to plug in your Android phone charger. That's what I do but it also has an option for batteries. I think that is a pro because it makes the mirror so much more portable if you don't want to bring any extra cables or if the power happens to go out. The light is very ambient but bright enough to see exactly what you're doing. You get so much more clarity than trying to do this in the bathroom mirror. I highly recommend this mirror. It's fairly lightweight, portable, you have several different options for magnification. Awesome mirror in my book! Overall, I highly recommend everyone get this mirror if you want to stop looking for the right lighting just so you can do your makeup. The LED lights provide the perfect lighting everywhere and the magnified mirrors really come in handy. Such good quality at an amazing price. The mirror is about the size of my iPad Air 2 before you open the little doors so it's just the right size."",1
""This is an amazing diffuser and I have really enjoyed using it. I have several others but this one is larger and can run longer. The wood grain finish is especially pretty and matches well in the bedroom where I use it. It's nice at night to wake up and have subtle light in the room. Just plug it in, add water and a few drops of your favorite essential oil and your home will smell great. Add more oil for a dinner scent or less for something more subtle. Very easy to use and clean. Just press the button on the front side to set the timer and walk away. The diffuser emits a fine steam that smells amazing. I also like the ability to change the light to different colors or have it change on its own. Exactly as described by the manufacturer. A user-friendly device that is very simple to set up, clean, refill, and operate. One button turns on/off the light, which changes colors and adds ambiance to any room. The vapor function works on a timed cycle that is operated by the push of one button. The aroma begins immediately and provides a very pleasant scent to our large living room-kitchen-dining-office area. It also holds a lot of water and therefore doesn't have to be refilled after one use on the max number of hours. Can't find any fault with this unit. I would definitely recommend this. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this."",0
""The cable seems very well constructed. The connectors are nice and solid and provide a good fit. The line itself is a very nice quality braiding. I purchased a Samsung 4K TV a while ago but had much older HDMI cables I was using and wow what a difference the new HDMI cables have made with the picture. These cables are reasonably priced and have great quality workmanship. They are made really good with braided cords to help protect the wires on the inside. The tips are gold and help to have a better quality picture of your HD TV. I would recommend these."",0
""This is a heavy-duty case but it isn't a heavy case. I have a daughter who has reached the age that she's all arms and elbows and awkward clumsy moments. This means that the iPad has been dropped and bumped and jarred around. In fact, one iPad has been dropped and fixed so many times it finally just had to be replaced. So we thought we'd try this case instead. This case was easy to install on the iPad. Additionally, once it is on, it stays on. This means the iPad isn't slipping out of the case to fall on the floor, nor is it slipping around in the case. It fits well. The holes in the case align perfectly and we have had no problem using headphones or charging the iPad with the case on. One of the bonus parts of this case is the built-in screen protector. That was a plus for us since it meant only one item to protect it all. The screen did not have the rainbow view I've read about so that is nice. Great product. Would recommend it."",0
""The camera came in Amazon's standard cardboard packaging to avoid any damage during shipment, it comes in an attractive box and would make an ideal gift. This WiMiUS action camera came in almost all the necessary accessories you will ever need on an action camera. A backup battery comes with the package allowing more filming and more beautiful pictures. There are, in fact, more reasons that I decided to purchase this action camera. First of all, the image surely has high definition and video is able to offer 4K quality, which allows me to catch all the great moments when I am recording, the video has pretty good continuity. Secondly, the action camera can be controlled using wifi, which is an awesome function, and taking a selfie of a group of people at a distance becomes possible. No need to carry a selfie stick all the time. Also, I can mount the action camera somewhere and use the controller to take a video or photo of myself in motion. Most importantly, the price is attractive. Unlike some high-brand product, this action camera can be purchased at a pretty reasonable price, yet, without losing camera performance or image quality. If the budget is not allowed for some high-end product, this action camera is just the right one, even for real X-sports. The 4k video quality and 1080p picture quality, in my opinion, is amazing for such a price. This is just the perfect camera for sports as videos don‚Äôt get blurry when there is too much movement or shaking, the picture is clear and crisp. Wide-angle option up to 170 degrees, I like this feature because it's really useful when trying to capture a beautiful landscape. It has an awesome feature of hooking it up through wifi to your device that is very cool and convenient to share content fast and on the go. Lightweight and a pretty small size even comparing to similar analogs. The camera has an extensive menu of features that is extremely easy to navigate to get the exact picture or video that you need for what you are trying to achieve. The menu is very intuitive for all the major important options. If you don't have a need for all the other settings then they will not get in your way, because in terms of user-friendliness it is very easy to use. Comes with an abundance of accessories and the accessories are of good quality. It is a very versatile action camera. I think the waterproof casing is awesome. I highly recommend this camera. It is great to bring to places where you won't bring a regular camera or a phone. I am very happy with the purchase of this item. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this."",1
""This was delivered securely in Amazon's standard packaging to avoid any damage and arrived on time as expected. To start off I have put the review into categories. How it Feels: Perfect fit for any size hand really. It has an ergonomic feel to it, and I never feel like my hand needs to do any extra stretching or compressing to cooperate with mouse usage. Very nice grip pad feel to it, builds your confidence to know it won't slip out of your hand, and just generally a nice feeling to have. How it Looks: It looks like any expensive gaming mouse. It has a streak of light down each side of the mouse towards the bottom where your palm would lay (mostly for looks, and doesn't affect usage of mouse whatsoever), it's even been extruded inwards to avoid having to feel the streaks while using the mouse. How Well Does it Function: This does not need to be a mouse for gaming. I think it'd be useful for daily users as well while adding some neat looks rather than a boring old mouse. Could also be a great conversation starter. Anyways, have not had any problems with it since I've got this. Works like any mouse would, it uses an optical mode. No lags, no disconnects, no stalling. Buttons have a nice feel and sound to it when you click them, all of them. Features: It has the usual left and right button, but it also has an anti-skid scroll wheel which is awesome. It has indents so you could have that nice feel to it when scrolling, and never accidentally scroll too far because you slip. Has two programmable side buttons as mentioned in the specs of the product. It's very useful even just to browse the internet, you can click the side buttons to either go forward a page or backward to the previous page. I've not thought much about it before buying, but have been using it almost religiously since. A plus: The wire is 1.7 meters in length. Overall: It is worth the money. Whether you're a gamer or a normal average computer user, this mouse would be perfect. Keep in mind, this is a perfect mouse for gaming if you're just the average gamer. Obviously, if you're full-on a game enthusiast to the max, you probably wouldn't even be looking at this mouse. Recommend this product."",0
""This is a very sturdy and convenient car mount, and definitely one of my favorites by far. It installs very easily, and the mount makes the phone firm and stable but easily positionable in any direction. The phone rotates 360 degrees and angles in almost any direction. The magnet feels strong, even though a case--too strong to come off the mount by accident but easy to unmount with a firm pull. This magnetic mount is much better than some of the vent car mounts I've tried because the phone can easily overheat when you are using heat in the car if it's right in front of the vent. It also doesn't require any fidgeting when you are mounting and unmounting the phone - you just stick it on the mount and go. I was a little hesitant to stick the adhesive metal circle onto the back of the phone, but it lies completely flat under the case so that I don't even know it's there. And for those few times when I have the case off, the design of the plate is nice and doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone. No more having my phone fall off when I'm driving because it's sitting on the dash - I can easily see and access the screen while I'm driving. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this."",1
""These lights are great, you can do so many different things with them! I really like the copper wire versus the white or green coated plastic wire you get with a typical string of lights. They seem so simple when you look at them right out of the package. But they add a fantastic look to any d√©cor idea. The copper wire makes it very discreet and the LEDs are small so you really don't notice that they are around the branches of the trees until you light them up and they just look beautiful. The warm white color looks cozy because it is NOT that artificial super bright white. and yes, they are LED, so the energy consumption of the whole series is like one small bulb. With 5 modes ON /Flash/Timer / Timer Flash / OFF, the timer set can be 6 hours on and 18 hours off on each day which will last for more than half a month, these are powered by 6 AA batteries, rechargeable ones would be ideal, overall I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this."",0

""This review is written by my wife. This dress is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't have been happier when I first tried it on. The fit and style are exactly like the picture, which is a big relief. I also love the material. It is nice and thick and not cheap. This dress has easily become my favorite and my default for any summer day that I want to dress a bit nicer. The great thing about this dress is that you can wear it anywhere since it is so casual. I love that. I cannot say enough about this dress. For the price, this is by far a super deal and I expect the dress to last years."",0

""It works great and is a life saver if you use a flask a lot. I travel a good bit now and take a flask with me. Having this makes it 100% easier to fill the flask than bending a plastic cup. It's well made and will not retain odors or flavors after a simple water rinse."",0
""This Kit came securely packaged to avoid any damage. I'm really impressed with this, it's easy to figure out and to set it up for use. These are great lenses I ever had for my phone. They work great and are easy to assemble, adjust and focus. It was really fun and cool. Great quality and durable. Easy to carry around anywhere. It enhances the power and usability of my iPhone during a nature trip. Now, I can take sharper and brighter pictures of objects that are in the far distance. They come with a small carrying bag to keep them from getting lost. I never thought I'd be able to get this much zoom with my phone, this paired with the phone's built-in zoom gets spectacular pictures. I tested it in my house on a flower and it turned out very clear. I can literally think of 100 things I want to take pictures of with my phone that I couldn't simply because it was too far or too small, but now with this zoom, I don't have to compromise image quality to get a zoomed-in image! Overall opinion: Great photography accessory, really makes a difference to your camera. Makes a standard camera look professional, definitely worth the buy, the lens itself is great quality and comes in a well-protected box so no damages to your package, also fits on phone well and is light and secure. Great product."",1

""It really works and works wonders. USES: * You can put anything on top of it for baking and nothing will stick. The first instinct is to bake cookies on them and you will be surprised how EVEN they will bake. * I then tried frozen fish with dry rub condiments and it came out perfect. The skins don't stick and everything just slides off the mat. No oil added whatsoever. * I frequently make croissants and notice that the bottom won't burn as fast as when done on a plain baking sheet. * I also use the mat to handle sticky items like sugar for candy-making and dough. You won't need any flour to spread on the counter as this does the job just fine. You will wonder how you were able to bake without it for the longest time. CLEANING: * The best part is the cleanup. You soak it in water and simply wipe off the food particles on the mat. * For a thorough cleaning, just use mild soap and a soft sponge. * Stick it from the freezer to the oven and back to the freezer and it is perfectly OK. Nothing will crack or burst from the changing temperature - unlike glass pans. * It is very flexible. Bend it, roll it, spread it out and use it for your rolling pin for the top and bottom. * That being said, enjoy the product and the wonder that it does. But use it with care. If used properly, it is worth every money spent."",1

""This is a really nice set of measuring cups and spoons. My wife recently started seriously baking and wanted an upgrade from all the hodgepodge plastic measuring cups and spoons, and a silicone set, that she had been using. Very pleased with these. They are well made and sturdy and seem to be pretty accurate. She has not done any precise measurements but they are at least as reliable as the ones she replaced. i.e. No appreciable differences in volume measurements between the various sets.These are well made. I like things to be as indestructible as possible, with a long, useful life. These will last. These are nice quality, and with reasonable care, should last forever.The measurements are stamped into the spoons and cups. That was a requirement for her. She also really likes the little pouring lip on the cups.After shopping around pretty extensively and comparing prices and quality, these were a really good buy.Very happy with these.I would definitely recommend these"",1

The treble and mid-range of the headphones are extremely clear. The bass is strong and well defined.

"This is my first bluetooth earphones purchase, and so far I'm very pleased.Pairing with a device was a snap, and the sound is great for a non audiophile -- there's more bass than any plug-in headphones I own, and the earbuds -- even without using any of the included attachments -- are truly noise canceling. Standing at my desk, I'm completely immersed in writing this review and cannot hear what my family is yammering at me.Lastly, charge time is fast, and the battery life is good, though I haven't measured either other than empirically. And I've only recharged the unit a few times",1

"‚ÄúSimilar to other reviews, the placement of the earbud fitting is a bit odd, since its not centered..but for me, it fits well, and the sound is very nice. Good bass, and nice trebs. I've gotten headphones that were horrible, and I'm not the type to spend megabucks for a set of headphones...Most I spent at the local Fry's store is around ¬£20 or so, but these are among the clearest sounding ones I've had, and they fit well with my ear holes...for a lot cheaper",0
"‚ÄúThese are the first in-ear headphones I have found that fit my small ear opening. They have 3 sizes of inserts and I needed the smallest ones.

I will definitely recommend purchasing these headphones!‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúUnder ¬£10 and sound this great? Buying this should be a no brainer! One tip - I noticed far better sound when I inserted the headphones slightly into my ear versus pushing these all the way in. The latter results in muted sound and lost clarity. I still can't believe these are just ¬£10! I have spent far too much money on other brands like MEE Electronics, JBL, etc and have been sorely disappointed. Not with these ones!What are you waiting for ... Order it already",0

I am a Sennheiser man to the core..... that being said i gave her my 30 pound sennheiser earbuds and took these from her!!!

"‚ÄúThere is no reason I shouldn't throw this into the 5 star rating. Price alone makes this worth buying. Are you getting Beats by Dr. Dre?.. no you are getting a solid unit.I bought these after I lost my travel set.First the negatives:The cord quality isn't amazing. I could see this unit fray and start to short out (as so many of my buds have done). Though I have to admit I wind these around my hand and throw them into my laptop case and the cables aren't looking too bad.The sound is OK... quiet compared to others I have tried (but notice others were more expensive than this).The good:My problems with my last headset is that the ear buds kept falling out. This unit will not have that problem, in fact getting the rubber off and on is kind of a pain... but a much better pain then losing them.The price is unbeatable for what you get.I find this comfortable (again compared to similar models).You looking for a headset that works, is worth the money then you want this unit",0
"‚ÄúI've had 5 of these and they are the best headphones for the price. Clear sound and an inline mic make it highly functional for those who love music and want to contact those on the go. Some reviewers said that one side of their earbud crapped out after a couple of weeks. This only happened to me when I accidentally put it in the washing machine. So don't be an idiot like me and damage your earphones. I put mine in a case storage so I don't damage them and even if I do I'm only set back a Hamilton",0

I tend to lose headphones often, so I wasn't looking to spend much. Based on the great reviews, I went for these. The reviews were spot on. I got much more than I could have expected from a cheap pair of headphones. I would recommend these to anyone!",0
"‚ÄúGreat product. Very easy to set up and use and seems to be very accurate so far in counting steps and tracking sleep. Lightweight and comfortable to wear - I forget I have it on",0
"‚ÄúThis little guy is amazing. Was blown away by how loud it was and the quality of the sound it puts out. I was using an older Jam for work and beach vacations, but I'm stoked that I'll be bringing this guy on my next trip. We'll see how it holds up in that environment. I had this at work with me yesterday and its loud and clear. Bass is pretty good also for what it is.....just remember its not a sub. For the cost, you can't co wrong",0
"‚ÄúHeadphones work great, good sound, easy to pair, and come with a bunch of tips so you can choose what works best. Seller (7desk) checked in after receiving product. I had a small problem with the foam tips and mentioned this in reply to sellers email. Even though I wasn't expecting them to do anything about it, they were able to provide a fix to the issue quickly. Product and customer service exceeded expectations. I wish every seller on Amazon was like 7desk",1
"‚ÄúI used to go through a pair of earbuds about every 2 to 3 weeks. They always end up getting crushed by books, my laptop, or me stepping on them; but not these. These are easily the most durable earbuds I have ever owned. I'm going on 3 months with these things, and i'm still so pleasantly surprised with this product. If you have the same problem I did, get these and you will not regret it",0
"‚ÄúThis speaker is amazing. Its larger size than I expected. Clear sound with bass. The battery life is amazing. I can select the color style I like, about 7 color styles. Of course I can turn off the LED lights. Absolutely worth $ 59.99",0
"‚ÄúThis small product works just like a bigger one. It looks and sounds great. Great for teens and can be carried wherever they go. Make a great gift or stocking stuffer. Would recommend it to others",0
"‚ÄúOh my, you wouldn't believe this! I have been using this earbug for over a month already and it still works great! No damages, no error, no sound different...nothing! Just great as it was new! I love this. I already recommended this to my sister and she likes it too. Great price for a great quality product!I always wanted a great sound earbuds for long, but they are all too expensive and I don't think it worth that much.So when I see this one with over 10 thousands reviews saying this is awesome...I have to try it!And yes, I LOVE IT! Like others!This product has a really great sound and a really cheap price! It also fits into my ears SO WELL!!! That's the most amazing part about this, it really won't fell out like other earbuds.But on'y one downside is that the string is easy to mash together and you need 2 minutes to fix it.. Well, I am thinking to buy a case for it so it won't be like that too bad.Also, if I lost it, I will still get this one again NO DOUBT. Great sound, great in-ear design, and great price! Where can you find it?Afterall, this is the first earbuds that I think is worth the price and really great condition!!! You gotta believe all the good reviews I guess",0
"‚ÄúI have to say these earbuds are the best I've had yet! And the prices was unbeatable! I run and these things stay snugly in my ears and are comfortable as well! The sound is a bit low but I got use to it and it does drown out most outside noise. Will absolutely buy again! Can't beat what you get for the price",0
"-The sound quality is good for the price -sturdy earphones and does not look as if it can be broken easily -It can reduce surrounding noise,even when played at high volumes it cannot be heard by those around you.,0I've had these earbuds for a few months now and I love them so much. For less than ¬£15, these actually sound good enough for me to write a five-stars review. I watch a movie or listen to music in bed and fall asleep with these in my ears, they are not uncomfortable. Want to buy another set for my wife. Highly recommend!",0
"‚ÄúRead the reviews and decided to try these out. I didn't need them and have 4 other sets of cheapo earbuds. I've been blown away by these ones.The sound quality seems to be good. I'm no audiophile and months of riding motorcycles/snowmobiles, playing in a band, etc have made me less picky about hearing the nuances of my music. That said, these seem to deliver stronger, thumpier (not like headshaking but a nice solid sound) bass than the Gummy earbuds and the iFrogz (cheapest set they make) I purchased a few months ago. The highs on the iFrogz seem to be about the same.The biggest thing I've noticed with these headphones is that the cord is way quieter than on any of the other cheap earbuds I've tried. I wore these snowmobiling and was blown away by the lack of staticy scrunching noises from brushing against my shirt/jacket liner. I personally like the 90* connector, it lets me route the cord around my kindle case then close the case so I can toss it in my backpack while riding and not have to worry as much about it getting smashed up and have tunes in the snow.I've recommended these particular earbuds to 2 friends now and will continue to do so until I find something better",0
"‚ÄúThese in-ear earbuds truly are the best ones that exist on this planet, at this price range. No they are not the best ones that exist, but are absolutely incredible for the low price. They actually sound very good and are quite comfortable. Comfort is a huge factor with earbuds, not only sound quality. They will sound really awful if you do not have the right fit though. They come with 3 different size covers, so make sure you try all 3, in both ears, to find the best fit. If you do not get the right fit then you will not get the great sound that can be achieved with these. Yes, I said try all 3 different sizes in BOTH of your ears. Your left and right ear canal MAY actually be shaped differently. I was aware of this and I went back and forth with all three sizes to find the best fit, and best sound for me, when I first opened them. The largest size is what works best for me. These are quite amazing. If I was to point out the biggest downside of these earbuds I would have to say the isolation is a little lacking. If you don't know what that is then you probably don't really care. Bottom-line is that you should own at least one pair of these, even if you have really awesome expensive ones. These are cheap and sound amazing. Very satisfied with my purchase!",0
"‚ÄúGreat sounding earbuds. Very comfortable to wear.The sound quality for ear buds is exceptional.They're a great producer for the price.Came As Listed",0
""Stays in snug, maintains good sound quality, and does so cheaply. The little fittings are unusual in that they are oblong, but this works really well for the product. As with any headphones that use the thicker rubber earpieces, they can cause a little irritation after a while if you're not used to wearing them.I bought three of these instead of shelling out the money to buy a pair of lesser-quality headphones with better marketing."",0
""Lots but simple to say:1.The package is tidy and nice, of course the shipping speed is fast, ordered it on Tuesday, received on the Wednesday!2.Come with two pairs of extra ear tips in different size, the small ones suits me well, feel comfortable in this size.3.Bass included! and sound is clear!4.Everything seems good of it except for the price, it is a bit expensive to me, but it is really a awesome headphones."",0
"‚ÄúThese sound awesome, especially for the price. The sound is very clean, though the bass is a little weak. I bought a pair of the Amazon Basics In-Ear Headphones at the same time to compare. The Amazon Basics Headphones are good, but the sound is not nearly as clean as these. The bass in the Amazon Basics headphones is much better, but the sound is a bit grainy and distorted in my opinion. The headphones are comfortable, and the shape of the ear buds Nice indicate which ear they go in, with out having to look at the R/L letter, a nice touch if you're putting them on in the dark. The quality of the materials these are made with feels good, but the Amazon Basics feel a bit better. However, I purchased a pair of these two months ago which still work today. I bought these because one of my kids took my old pair to use. Finally, beware of the packaging, they are hard to get into and the extra ear cushions (Small/Large) will go flying. I would buy these again‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúSome maniac wrote a very technical review for these, and how great they were.... I appreciate the opinion of that maniacal variety and so I bought em! its true.... I dont appreciate all the sound techie stuff I'm sure.....but they are way better than the ones Ive been using....and they fit great and stay in, which is a huge plus for me... It is also true that they are very insulating or whatever it is that makes it dangerous to use while running, since you can't hear outside noise at all! So I do use just one ear when I'm running in traffic lest I get ran over to Bon Jovi's greatest hits! Great price too! Yay",0
"‚ÄúEasy to link. Good volume and clear sound. Good battery life.",0
"‚ÄúI was skeptical as to if they would be as good as the bit more expensive black/white ones I had purchased. They are awesome. I am going to purchase a few more pairs of the green ones (because they are the cheapest) to have at work, and as a backup pair or just to use for something if I cant find my main pair. They block out sound pretty well and have good bass. MXditect is on point with their ear buds",0
"‚Äúcomfortable, light-weight and great sound",1
"‚ÄúThese headphones are a fantastic value for the money. I am not an audio expert, but I do use these headphones every day, and they always deliver the same clear sound and good bass day in and day out. What is particularly good about these headphones is the design of the earpiece. I have tried several different kinds of in-ear headphones, and these are the ones that fit the best (I have small ears and this makes it difficult to find a pair that stays in my ear). Only one drawback to these headphones - they don't have a slider on the cord, but I just loop the extra one over my ear when I want to listen to only one headphone.",0
"‚ÄúI have had these for 3 months. They have withstood all sorts of abuse, and sound as good as the day I got them! Which is pretty good!- Good sound quality. Good bass.- They stay securely in my ears. They are also very comfortable. Other earbuds fall out and/or hurt, I can wear these for hours with ease.- They block just enough outside noise that you can listen to your music in peace, but they aren't absolutely noise canceling so you are able to have some awareness of your surroundings.- I have sweated all over these, even washed them, with no damage to them!These are by far the best earbuds I have ever used.",0
"‚ÄúVery happy with the item, it is as described and quiet a good quality. Sound output is also good for the price. Mic also works well with Bluetooth connectivity to phone, pairing was also super easy",1
"‚ÄúThese are legit amazing.The price point is great. The durability is excellent. The comfort is unparalleled.I can't comment on the sound as compared to other earbuds because prior to buying these, I'd been unable to use earbuds for the previous two decades. Everything just _hurt_ my ear canals. I have left these in overnight, on long plane flights, and for hours of study / gaming time with absolutely no discomfort. I was even pleasantly surprised to find the medium sized buds fit my ears best, which means that somewhere, some people with even more trouble than I've had are probably throwing a party upon using the smallest size.The sound quality seems on par with the ultra-high quality, cushioned, noise-cancelling gaming headsets I've had with two exceptions:1. Bass doesn't have quite the same resonance.2. Directional sound is limited.That being said, for ten bucks, trying these was one of the best purchase decisions I've ever made.I've bought five or six pairs and everyone I've given them to has come straight back to buy them again as soon as they needed more. My SO's pair is finally beginning to fail (in terms of the connection, not the sound) after a months of daily use for 8+ hours. Last week he asked plaintively if I could find more exactly like them, which prompted a discussion of their virtues (and this review.)Try these--you won't go back.",0
"‚ÄúSmall, lightweight, and compact. Not the most comfortable and not the best sounding, but they are cheap and do the job. Use these at work with periods of listening to music for 2 hours at a time. Have no complaints at all",0
"‚ÄúGood thin Leather Case, not plastic, the phone is thin and nice sitting in your hand",1
"‚ÄúWell not to be to cliche...but this is the pair for you! I want to start off by saying that most if not all other in ear conforming headphones have never stayed in my ears. With whatever I happened to be doing at the time of wearing them, they always eventually slid out, whether just casually listening, running, lifting weights, and biking, they always slid out of my ears eventually. This pair however fits..perfect. And the fit doesn't sacrifice the sound, the sound quality is great compared to a lot of other top notch crazy expensive ¬£100-100 pairs of headphones. I would recommend this in a heartbeat. So if you find yourself in my situation where your ears just seem to hate every existing pair of in ear headphones, look no further, just buy these and everything will work out just right and you'll never see yourself buying another pair again...until you need to replace these, but with the cost being so low that wouldn't be much a problem when the time came anyways, would it?That is all! If you have a budget of ¬£20 pounds you can buy these and still stay under budget, its a steal.Thank you for the fantastic creation.Peace",0
"‚ÄúReally good headphones. The sound quality is excellent. These are terrific in-ear headphones that look and sound awesome. I really like the look of these, quality construction, and come with different sizes of ear tips, so that I can find the most suitable and comfortable size for my ears, after all, I really like listen to music with headphones for a long time",0
"‚ÄúThese work better than any others we've tried yet, including an active-noise-reduction set. Sound quality is excellent. They stay in ear canals better than any others we've used, although they too tend to gradually work loose and have to be re-seated every ten or fifteen minutes. They block ambient noise quite well when fully inserted. The price is more than reasonable. We now have three of these; two we use all the time, and one spare. My advice is to keep them clean. I wipe them off after every use and use q-tips to clean the inside of them every few times also. So long as you do that it appears they might last forever",0
"‚ÄúBest fitting earbuds I?ve ever come across. These are pretty wonderful earphones for a nice price. Unlike my other earbuds purchased before, these don?t hurt me and feel very comfortable when I use and I do trust I can use them for a very long time. The button on line is useful, calls can be answered by pressing it and also works for play/pause. The built quality is very worth the price and even beyond my expectation. Awesome product",0
"‚ÄúLove these bracelets. Simple and generous appearance, quick connect Bluetooth, easy to use",0
"‚ÄúFor past few years I've had pairs of earbuds, most of them are poor quality in both comfortability and the deliver of the sound quality.I was totally disappointed after many trys.It was not until I get this pairs of earbuds did I realize that this is exactly what I'm looking for, impressive bass and the best wearing experience I've ever own(maybe the size of the silicone ear tips is prefectly fit)In all I love this pairs of delicate earbuds which aslo have powerful function on wired control",0
"‚ÄúThese headphones worked as a charm replacing my old generic ones. Despite we are talking about a low-price ones, they made a well product here. Wires are kind of messy, yes, not flat nor anti-knot, but if you are methodical when storing them you could keep them for months without breaking it.Take into consideration that these are in-ear headphones, and you will be isolated from the world with a pretty decent bass and quality. Definitely not recomended for maniac audiophiles, but for a regular guy it does the job decently",0
"‚ÄúIn my opinion, these are the best value headphones anyone can buy. They are really cheap and provide amazing sound for their price. They don't sound perfect next to some of the pricier headphones, but great when compared to Skullcandy or other comparably priced buds. In addition they don't contain some of the features which are commonplace on many headphones such as a microphone or wireless Bluetooth connectivity. This is not worth removing a star from the review, however, because they are so cheap. I found these fit really well in my ears. They include three options (sizes) for tips and unless you have really small ears, should fit great.Anyone on a budget looking for some great earbuds should consider these",0
"‚ÄúWhat a great deal! Not only do these stay in your ear infinitely better than the ones they're replacing, but they also provide a small level of noise reduction. I use these while running and they are exactly what I was looking for. I no longer have to really crank up the sound or worry about the earbud flipping out of my ear. You do have to take one out to talk to someone or you'll catch yourself yelling at them. For this price, I might need to get some backups!",0
"‚ÄúThis tiny speaker has amazing sound...I have it linked to my echo dot...the dot sounds a little tinny without an additional speaker...plus with this speaker I can take it from one room to another...nice clean sound...no vibration plus a really great price...don't think twice...just buy it",0
"‚ÄúI bought these headphones when I lost my apple earpods. I wanted something that had good quality, especially bass, the sound of these earbuds is wonderful and it is great about getting rid of outside noise. they stay in my ears very well during heavy exercise, and are hardy despite their very lightweight features. Very happy with the purchase and is probably one of the better value headphones you can buy",0
"‚ÄúSimply the best bang for your buck ear buds. Choose the correct pad size for your ears - makes a huge difference when you have a snug fit. Unless you've got Clark Kent hearing and Lex Luther cash to burn",skip the ¬£250 pairs and grab a pair of these instead.	0
""Bluetooth speaker feels very solidly constructed and durable. Rubber accents feel very nice in the hand. Speaker has nice weight to it but not heavy. The biggest surprise is the sound...these sound great for the price, and get louder than you would expect. Will fill your room with sound.Overall, these are a very good value and u will be pleased to know that u got more than your money's worth"",1
"‚ÄúStill great after a month. I bought two of these for my husband and I. A month ago, the left side of my headphones started to sound a little lower than than right, but its still great. My husband has had no issues with his. The best part about these is how great they fit my ear. I have always had issues with other headphones because of the fit. These are also great if you are working and you sweat. They rarely fall out. For the price, these definitely deserve 5 stars!!!",0
"‚Äúthis is my first review on a product ,and i have to share my thoughts so other can see about how good this product is,these are the nokia 3310 of earphones, just bought 2 more pairs . and i still using my old one for workouts ,after pulling them with my weights by accident ,the dog chewin them ,the sweat , and more ,these are still working!!! i spent a lot of money in earphones ,beats ,monster,skullcandy,brainwaves you name it ,i used them all ,and they all failed, but this earphones still work ,and with an awesome sound . for its price ,durability ,sound and how they fit this is the best you can get !",0
"‚ÄúI was histant to writing a review because i know if all the good reviews keep coming like there are now, the price can skyrocket. but since i've bought 3 pairs of these, i will review. THEY ARE FANTASTIC! Sound quality is awsome, the length of the cord is perfect for athletes so they can leave it in thier shorts and wear them without worrying about that little 'tug" on your ear when you run. The only problem is the quality it is made of. They seem like they can rip real easily but thats why you need to take care of these, since they are so awsome for the price. Pleeeeease don't raise the price on these. By birthday il buy like 12 or something. Lol i dont want to encourage bad reviews either so they ruin the good backround these headphones been getting so keep the good reviews coming. KEEP THE PRICE NO HIGHER THAN 7 PLEASSSSEEE"",0
"‚ÄúI received these in the mail a couple of days ago and I really like them! They are super cute and feel comfy in me ears. I usually have problems with other headphones because they tend not to fit well in my ears because they are too big or just awkwardly uncomfortable in my ears. AND the pink color is very pretty :) I'd recommend these to anyone who is looking for simple and comfy headphones.",0
""A great fitness tracker that works very well.The strap is comfortable to wear for a long time.This fitness tracker looks great, has a clear easy to read screen when indoors,It can connect with your iPhone or Android Phone through Bluetooth and a SmartWatch App, the App has various functions like various fitness activities and fitness goals for you to achieve.Setting up the device is simple,easy to use and easy to charge.For the price this fitness tracker is actually amazing. The strap is comfortable and the digital screen is nice and bright. Overall score I give is 10/10, great fitness watch with a great price."",0
"‚ÄúI bought plenty of these and they've never failed me. Ever time I get a pair someone likes them so much I let them have them. Can't go wrong with these. They have good sound, stay in my ear, and don't break easily. Have recommended it to anyone I know who needs new earbuds‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúI was very skeptical when I received this, I destroyed my ¬£80 pair of Monster earphones at work by accident & decided to get a cheap replacement to hold me over. The packaging & earphones themselves look rather cheap, maybe even low quality.But boy was I wrong, they may not be flashy like most high end earphones but it easily makes up for it in quality. I have a very active job & strength train 5 times a week & these have special curvature for the ear so they firmly stay in place, even with movement. The sound itself is quite good, doesn't sound or feel cheap! Easily the best & least expensive earphones I've ever purchased",0
"‚ÄúRidiculously FAST Shipping! Amazon is the BEST! These earphones sound GREAT for the price. I brought them for my PS Vita and you can definitely tell the difference. I didn't realize the Vita had so much Bass until I put these on. It makes MLB The Show 13 feel like you're at a real baseball game, in the stadium. PS Vita must use Dolby Digital sound, or at least that's what these earphones make it sound like! Very Happy with my purchase and for the price you can't beat it!‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúThese are possibly the best ear-buds I have owned. I bought these based on all the positive reviews and I'm glad I did. I am really amazed at how comfortable these are. I have always had issues finding ear-buds that fit in my ears and don't make them hurt after a while. These sit very comfortably and I'm able to wear them for hours on end. Sound quality is ok. Not for the audiophile, but it does the job for casual listening. The cord is a little short to use for a computer, so I had to buy 3.5mm extension.Pros:- Comfortable- CheapCons:- Cord is short if using for a computer- Not the greatest sound quality",0
"‚ÄúThese Ear Buds are very comfortable, I can leave them in my ears for hrs without any noticeable discomfort. The sound is greatfor this price as well. If you listen to Heavy Metal music, the bass sound on these ear buds is incredible. They also stay in your ears whileexercising, jogging, or lifting the weights. These this brand Earbuds replaced my old Sony Earbuds which were over 6yrs old and out-performed them by a wide margin. If you're looking for some quality earbuds, check these out now!	‚Äú",0
"‚ÄúThey have great sound,compatible with many kinds of music.Metal shell is very low profile,so it seems to be durable.Only issue is that the dual driver earbuds is little expensive",0

"‚ÄúThis lighter is black with zinc alloy detailing which gives it a nice, smart look (not plastic like most standard lighters). The design is fit for men and women. It uses no gas, just electricity to make the 2 arcs. This means that it is wind proof, due to it being flameless, so you don't need to seek shelter in the wind when lighting up cigarettes or cigars etc.The box that the lighter comes in matches the design of the lighter (black with bronze coloured lettering). The lighter is also pre-charged so you can use/test it as soon as its out the box.When you do eventually need to charge the lighter, there's a micro USB that is included with the lighter. The micro USB is used with most (if not all) android devices so you can use any of those chargers too. From flat to full, the charging takes around 2 hours and can last up to a week or 300 sparks with its lithium battery.When charging, the blue light flashes when it is charging and stays a solid blue when fully charged. When the battery is getting low, there's a red light to indicating that it needs to be charged.It has a decently sized cap which keeps it child safe when charging or not in use.It is very simple to use. All you need to do is flip the top and press the button. (The lighter will not spark when lid is closed.) The arc only lasts a couple of seconds (long enough to light up whatever you're smoking) and then stopped automatically to prevent unnecessary battery loss.The dimensions of the lighter is (cm) 7.3√ó2.8√ó1.1 and weighs about 70g. If you'd seen someone else with one of these, you wouldn't think it only costs ¬£15.99, it looks more valuable then what it is.I would highly recommend this lighter to anyone fed up with your standard gas lighters blowing out in the wind.",0

"‚ÄúMy daughter recently left home to live in student accomadation at university so i thought she might find this a useful addition to her kitchen No doubt her kitchen will not be a large and since she will be cooking for herself this little mini food processor might be just what she needs. I thought I would give it a quick road test myself first.Using the device could not be simpler. Put the food items into the bowl, place the lid and blades in position, fit the bottom of the motor housing unit into the groove on the lid top and holding the unit in place press down on one of the 2 large buttons on the top of the motor. The first button is for slow speed and the second is for the high speed setting I found the 300w motor converted my ice cubes to snow in just a few seconds and an onion was finely chopped in equally quick time. I see no reason why it should not be able to cope with all the culinary chopping and dicing needs of a single person or couple.The mini chopper comes with a silicone base ring to keep the unit from sliding around when in use/4 sharp blades to make light work of any chopping you want to do/a good quality reasonably sized glass bowl and 2 speed settings so that you have all the power you need for chopping all kinds of vegatables.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button.

They are very well made, easy to use, Nice designed and comfortable to hold. The ceramic plates are nice and wide (4.2 cm ) so she can straighten her hair faster with these hair straighteners as apposed to the narrow plate type 0f straightner.These hair straighteners are suitable for all types of hair and you can adjust the temperature according to hair condition. You can adjust it manually adjust the tempearture by pressing the " + " and " - " buttons.My daughtewr has naturally wavy hair and it works well for her hair at 200 degrees Celsius. It heats up fast, glides easily through her hair and leaves her hair smooth and silky.Therse hair straighteners look professional and feel durable. The power cord is long and the LCD screen is easy to read. It comes complete with a heat resistant glove to ensure you do not accidently burn your hand whilst useing it.Another safty feature is that if these staightners are accicently left on they will automatically shut themselves off after 30 minutes.It also comes with a manual instruction booklet which explains very well how to use the straightners properly and safley. These hair straighteners come very Nice presented. The box looks elegant and in my opinion, would make a lovely gift for friends and family.All in all, I am very impressed with these hair straighteners and happy to recommend it to everyone.‚Äù"",0

""This is my review of : Potato Masher, Stainless Steel Potato Masher by Froid Epoch,Good Grips Smooth Potato Masher Use for Vegetables,Fruits and Baby FoodExcellent masher. Sturdy materials; better quality stainless steel than any other mashers I have previously owned, and the horizontal grip is more user friendly than the more common vertical handle. Mashing potatoes is easier and quicker than traditional styles, helped by the heavier weight and larger surface area of the blade. Have tried with potatoes and swede so far, but see no reason why it should not cope just as well with other vegetables.So if you want a great masher for any vegetable this will do the job 100%!"",1
""This is my review of : Car Jump Starter RAVPower 8000mAh, Car Battery Booster with 300A Peak Current (for All 12V 2.0 L Gas Engines), Phone Portable Power Bank with Quick Charge 3.0, Built-In LED FlashlightThe 'Car Jump Starter RAVPower 8000mAh, Car Battery Booster with 300A Peak Current (for All 12V 2.0 L Gas Engines), Phone Portable Power Bank with Quick Charge 3.0, Built-In LED Flashlight' is made from great quality materials and feels sturdy well built.This is a very handy gadget to have either in the glove box, door pockets or the center arm rest storage without it taking up much space at all. It is very small and mobile for what it does.A neighbour of mine actually needed to use this. She came round because the battery on her car was completely flat as it had been standing unused for over a month. I took it over to her car, clipped it onto the battery and it started right up first time without any issues.The great thing about this small devise is you don't need another car, nearly bumper to bumper, awkwardly reaching across. You can just connect it up and start the car. Extremely simple. Just don't put the leads on the wrong way. The contents include: ?1√ó 8,000 mAh power bank (capable of producing, at peak, 300A of current) ?1√ó Micro USB charging cable ?1√ó Jump leads (red for + black for -) ?1√ó Mesh carry bag (unfortunately the leads do not fit in with it) ?1√ó User manual"",1
""Surprisingly the user manual is in perfect English and contains easy to follow instructions which can't be said for other products.For what the power bank is capable of it is quite light and mobile compared to others you may find. On the device you will find an input (for the micro USB) for charging the power bank, an output USB (to charge other devices such as phones ect.), an output socket for the jump leads under a rubber flap for protection and to keep water out and on the face of the power bank the power button.The power button, when pressed once will show the battery life left in the battery, indicated with blue LED lights on the face of the power bank in 25% increments (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). When held for 3 seconds, the bright LED torch will turn on. When the torch is on, press the power button to change modes from on, warning (flashing) and to SOS in case of an emergency then off. Also, the torch is great for finding the battery terminals at night.When charging the power bank from flat to fully charged takes around 2 hours and will provide around 3 jump starts on 1 full charge. When jumping the car, the power bank provides 300A of current (at its peak).If your battery pack is running low, and in emergency situations, you can connect another power bank to the jumper power bank using the micro USB input and do it that way. Although not recommended.RAVPower takes safety of customers and their products very seriously. The power bank/car jumper has a temperature sensor for 'optimal fire detection' which protects the power bank (and you) from reverse polarity (wrong leads on the terminals) and protection against over current, over loading, too much voltage and over charging.Finally, the RAVPower power bank/car jumper comes with a 30 day money back guarantee and an 18 month warranty.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button.

That's why I recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable rechargeable battery set for a reasonable price of ¬£23.99.
"The charging is a little slower than expected, however, because you now have 3 batteries, there's no need to worry about it because by the time you've used the one battery up",the other batteries will be ready to be used.
"There are 3 ways to charge your batteries. You can charge it using a plug",power bank or charge it in the car whilst you're driving. The batteries are 2900 mAh compared to the original 2200 mAh battery that comes with Sony cameras. So they last about 3.5-4 hours instead of (approx) 2 hours
""RAVPower takes safety of its customers and their products seriously. This is why the Sony rechargeable battery pack has protection against over charging/discharging, too much voltage, short circuits and over heating as well as being designed to be a fire resistant build.And for the cherry on top, the battery set comes with an 18 month warranty as well as a 30 day money back guarantee.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button.

""This is my review of : Anjou Ultrasonic 200mL Aroma Diffuser with Mist Control Essential Oil Diffuser for 12H Use ( Low Water Auto Shut-Off, 4 Timer Settings, 7 Colorful LED Lights and BPA-Free )I love this combined aroma/essential oil diffuser and mood lamp - its one of the best I've used and has a very nice finish to it as well as being well built and very sturdy.This diffuser is really stylish and is made from white plastic. The top has a gentle swirling design going all the way around it.Only the top peak is uncovered so that the lamp can let the mist out when you have it turned on and the frosted plastic will let it give out, a nice warm atmospheric glow.its very easy to set up, you just take the lid off, fill up the tank with water using the measuring beaker which comes included, put in a few drops of your chosen aromatherapy oil/fragrance, put the lid back on and plug it in with the UK 3 pin plug which comes with it and you're ready to fill your home with your chosen fragrance and the air-purifying mist. This is great for any dry rooms or areas in the house and it really improves the air quality as well as giving a lovely fresh feeling and aroma.The unit can be used in mist mode or purely in light mode only. It is really lovely in just the light mode and its very relaxing to watch it change colours. There is a mist on/off button on the front as well as a light on/off button. There is also a timer switch to set it to 1h,3h or 6h after which it will turn off. The unit is very safe to use as when the water runs out it turns off automatically.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button. Thanks"",0
""This is my review of : RAVPower Rechargeable Battery Pack for Dyson Handheld Vacuum Cleaners (2000mAh Replacement Battery Cell with Fully Compatibility for Dyson DC31, DC34, DC35, DC44, and 917083-01 models)The 'RAVPower Rechargeable Battery Pack for Dyson Handheld Vacuum Cleaners (2000mAh Replacement Battery Cell with Fully Compatibility for Dyson DC31, DC34, DC35, DC44, and 917083-01 models)' is an excellent battery pack for your Dyson hand held vacuum.For a penny under ¬£24 this rechargeable battery pack is roughly half the price of an OEM battery pack. This is compatible with Dyson type A battery powered vacuums (Not compatible with type B models).With it being a 2000 mAh lithium-ion battery, it has more power and more reliability than the original battery. With it being a better battery than the original, it also out performs the original battery when it comes to cleaning performance.The rechargeable battery pack is surprisingly more reliable than the original. It is estimated the battery will have about '2 to 3 years life span (or up to 500 charge/discharge cycles) which I found.Even though its lower in price, RAVPower takes safety of its customers and their products seriously. The battery pack comes with 3 lines of safety. This being over current protection, temperature control switch (to prevent overheating) and a thermistor to ensure the life span if the battery pack to be a long and safe operation to protect you, the battery and your vacuum. This is certified by CE, RoHS and FCCOverall this is a great alternative to the manufacturers more expensive part.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button. Thanks"",0

"‚ÄúJust a few tips if buying this kit: I would recommend deciding before you start how you wish to display the wings and then go through the instructions and cross out sections that are not relevant to your choice. Make sure to also pay particular attention to fitting the exhausts onto the engine near the bulkhead as it is easy to fix the exhausts out of line with the recesses for the exhausts in the fuselage.PS if you like this I would also recommend Revell model kit 04869 Fw 190 F8.",1

All leads are supplied to get you set up. The only tiny, tiny thing I would say (but i'm really struggling to find fault) is that when you change volume on the supplied remote, there is no visible way to tell if the unit is responding to the input, perhaps if the units blue light flashed to show the volume was being adjusted it would have been handy, but i really am nitpicking here!

"‚ÄúI have had these for 3 months. They have withstood all sorts of abuse, and sound as good as the day I got them! Which is pretty good!- Good sound quality. Good bass.- They stay securely in my ears. They are also very comfortable. Other earbuds fall out and/or hurt, I can wear these for hours with ease.- They block just enough outside noise that you can listen to your music in peace, but they aren't absolutely noise canceling so you are able to have some awareness of your surroundings.- I have sweated all over these, even washed them, with no damage to them!These are by far the best earbuds I have ever used‚Äù",1

"‚ÄúI would buy any brand of cheap earbuds, but they would fray before I'd finish using them.Then I would exclusively buy Gummy brand because the sound quality was no different, but the rubber sheath covering the cord would last much longer.Then the last Gummy gave out after a year or so and someone somewhere on the internet suggested these earbuds.The difference in sound quality is amazing! I didn't realize I'd been listening to poor quality sound for years until I bought this last month. They are a couple dollars more than the Gummy and they are worth it‚Äù",1

But for me that's where the love for this machine soon stopped.The remote was shocking I found I couldn't be further than a foot away and had to be directly in front.This I'm sure they're aware of because there's an app to use on your phone which was in my view was just as bad.Very limited where you can place this box as its a mere 2ft long.The firmware and software were out gunned by an old mbox that was less than half the price and no where near the process power.its now been sent back as I'm afraid online updates are not enough to carry this box to a top box status for me, and the search goes on!",1

"‚ÄúThese are, hands down, the best pair of in-ear headphones I've ever owned. Luckily, I read some of the reviews on here, so that I could realize the first fact I stated. You must use the rubber ear inserts that fit snugly in your ear. You'll get plenty of fine, clear tones in all the right range if you're wearing them properly.The sound is clear, rich and true, NOT scratchy or squeaky like many cheaper in-ear headphones. I'll leave these in a pocket or something and have my JVC earphones nearby, and they don't even compare to these. I immediately look for these headphones if I want to listen to something clearly. Furthermore, they block out sound almost as well as earplugs with how they fit on myself.Lastly, it seems to me that they are ergonomically designed to fit in the ear better. First: the rubber on the ear-insert is very pliable/soft. Second: the rubber ear-inserts take on a tilted oval shape because of the shape of the earphone speakers themselves. This makes them very comfortable to wear, even with the largest rubber ear-insert size (it comes with 3 sizes of rubber inserts/covers) that makes the best seal. Many, cheaper, in ear headphones are uncomfortable to wear and make your ears sore, but you can wear these all day without something stretching out your ear‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúThese headphones are the best!!! For under ¬£10, I can't believe how good these sound and the fit is so comfortable. These are perfect for running or working out or even casual listening, I love the fit and I have experienced no ear fatigue after wearing it for the whole day. I think the amazing ratings on Amazon for these headphones are completely justified‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúThese are the most comfortable earbuds I have ever tried, and the sound is really great. Would buy again‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúImpressive, quality headphones!‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúAs soon as I took them out of the box, stuck them in my ears and they are comfortable and sound amazing! Very surprised at the full isolated sound. Would definitely purchase another‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúI'm 6'2 and my only issue with these is that the cord is SLIGHTLY, and when I say slightly I really mean slightly too short for me. Maybe an inch or so too short. I don't mean they don't reach my head, I just have a preference for some leeway when I put them in my ears. And this feels a lil snugger on the cord than I'm used too. (Not an issue with the product just a preference)#5 Did I mention the price???? ¬£10??? REALLY??????? Jesus these are amazing when you factor this in. I'm considering getting 2 more pairs to keep around at home and in my car for whenever, just because they're so affordable and I get sad when I don't have them on me, but would love to listen to some music.Conclusion;There's a reason why these bad boys are at 4.5 star and reviewed by over 1+k people. They are that good for the price and you would be a fool not to get a pair of these just to have for whenever/whatever. Leave em in your car!!! I grantee you will thank me when you need a pair of ear-buds, but you left your favorite pair at home without thinking. Then, a few seconds into your despair ... 'Oh, that's right!!!! I have a backup pair in my car!!! Thanks random amazon dude!" So, you're welcome ahead of time!‚Äù"",0
"‚ÄúI received these on time and in good package condition. The boxing is decent if you would like to buy it as a gift, it came with a well packaged headphone, a charging cable and a audio cable. Everything works well on these and in good sound quality, clear voice and nice bass, I like it‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúThese things are incredible for the price. I've used earbuds regularly for over a months while exercising, while working in landscaping/farming, and presently as an attorney. The different types of work affect sound quality, given the types of ambient noise one experiences, the jostling of the headphones from movement, etc. In addition, I only buy headphones that are no more than ¬£100, preferably less than ¬£10, because I have a tendency to lose and/or destroy them. These are, hands down, the best pair I've ever had, even better than the ¬£100 Beats I used to buy. The fit is perfect, they do not jostle around in your ear, and because the fit is so snug (without being annoying), they eliminate ambient noise extremely well. For example, on a plane you barely notice the engine sound (relative to any other headphones I've owned).And the sound quality is the best I've ever experienced by long shot for a pair of earbuds. The bass is deep and full, mids are actually pronounced, and the treble is not piercing like it is frequently in earbuds. The clarity for something like jazz is not perfect if your an audiophile, but still better than anything else at this price point, or at numerous price points above it.NOTE: In order to maximize sound quality, you have to use the rubber piece that fits snugly into your ear. You also HAVE to wear the R headphone in your right ear and the L headphone in you left ear. I guarantee the reviewers complaining about the lack of bass are not wearing them correctly. When you do, the sound is nothing short of astonishing for pair of budget earbuds‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúThese earphones are a great value for their price. Music quality is great for an in-ear headphone. I ran over my last pair with my car and they survived another month before finally falling apart where I had cracked them.‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúNoise cancellation works great! They're relatively light weight and the sound is excellent. Bluetooth connectivity is easy. Really helps while studying and need to get rid of the noise‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúVery good sounding, tied for favorite, see comparisons below to other earbuds. You must pay attention and use the right tip for your ear, as this design does not go deep in ear and thus needs the right rubber tip to get good sound isolation.I compared the ergo-Fit on cell phone and laptop outputs, 6 different songs and the with other earbuds listed below:this brand Ergo-Fit ~¬£10.These are one of my two favorites due to better fit than HAFX1X and almost as good of sound, slightly better sound than Ink'd but not as good of fit -Bass-Excellent, not too boomy -Mid, Good -Highs, Good, not too much (like Ink'ed) -Comfort, Good, a little bit noticeable, but you can wear for many hours. Noise Isolation fit is good, you need experiment with tips to get it right as these leave no margin for error as they do not go deep into ear canal. However they tend to stay in place.SKULLCANDY Ink'd - ¬£11 Ok, no distortion, sometimes short on bass, good for vocals -Bass, good, but a little weak, if positioned well in ear bass can be good -Mid, Excellent, very clear vocals -Highs, Good, perhaps a little too much volume highs -Fit, Very comfortable and best at noise isolation, fitting deep in ear canal, making them my favorite along with the JVC HAFX1X ¬£25 - Beautiful sounds, well balanced, nice bass -Bass, OK, the best you'll ever experience in earbuds, almost too much. -Mid, Good, very clear vocals, despite a very rich bass -High, Excellent -Fit, I find it difficult to get them just deep enough to get good noise isolation, using the medium tips. But this made them to be uncomfortable and they WORK THEMSELVES LOOSE (from tight noise isolation fit). In general not uncomfortable, but very noticeable in ear due to large sizeMEELECTRONICS M6 - 18¬£ Very good,clear sound, no distortion, well balanced -Bass, Excellent, rich and natural sound, almost booming -Mid, Excellent, very clear vocals -Highs, Good, clear no distortion -Fit, Only seam to get good noise isolation fit with long triple flanged tip, but these are not comfortable to wear more than an hour or two.PHILIPS SHE6000/28 ~¬£14 -Balanced high, mid, and low ranges -Fit, comfortable since they don't go into ear much, 4 different size tips. Don't fit tight in ear, as not designed to go deep enough. Thus little noise isolation, and not suited to noisy environment. None-the-less, even though the do NOT seal-in the sound via tight fit, they seem to have good frequency balance. Also, not good to use for activities, as they easy to fall out. -Nice carry caseSONY MDR-EX300SL - 25¬£, Horrible, booming bass, distorted -Bass, Ok, booming, too much -Mid, horrible, distorted vocals -Highs, Bad, not present, no highs at all‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúWhen you look at them, the design may appear to be uncomfortable given its odd shape, however, this shape causes the ear buds to more snuggly fit into your ears. They produce good, clear sound quality and have a decent length.Now, I am not good at taking care of my things, I tend to break things, a lot. All my previous earphones have broken within one-to-two months, especially since I buy the cheap, 5-to-10 pound ones, however, the pair of these I bought has lasted me now around a months and have no sign of wear-and-tear.The only problem I can think of with these is that the ear pads tend to be a little unsecured. This means that they will sometimes fall off when you do not have them in your ear, this is not a common occurance, but it does happen sometimes. This personally wasn't a problem because I usually find the ear pads in my pocket, and even when I did not, which was once, I simply used the excess ear pads the earphones came with.All-in-all, this is a superb pair of earphones, they are light-weight, sturdy, have god audio quality, and are overall some of the best I have ever had.Final Score: 5/5‚Äù",1
"These are very, VERY good, and not just 'very good for the price. I'd say 'incredibly, impossibly good but I'm listening to them and this is reality...and I am fussy about sound quality (a multi-thousand pound home sound system, that's how fussy). Their noise isolation is excellent, too; so much so that on my next airplane trip, which is in a couple of weeks, my expensive Bose noise-cancelling earbuds are staying at home. These earbuds isolate as well as the Bose active cancellation system and the this brands sound BETTER than the Bose.These are so good, I just bought another set.‚Äù",0

I would say, on average, they last around 5-a months before they have to be replaced, which I think is pretty incredible considering how cheap they are.I'm not an audiophile, but I find the sound quality to be pretty good. The unique shape of the earbud makes it to where they sit perfectly in your ear. its really easy to swap out the buds if you want to clean them or replace them with a different size. By far the best budget earbuds out there‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúThese earbuds are very good and when used properly, i.e., fit *snugly* into the ears, have good-to-excellent bass response -- something I know a little about, as I've played bass guitar for months and I reflexively listen to the low end first whenever I hear a new song. On sound alone, I would give them a four-star rather than a five-star rating, as they are the slightest bit muddy in the mid-range compared to really good headphones. And I'm being picky, I know.However, what pushes my review to the five-star level is durability: I am extremely hard on earbuds, listening to my mp3 player while doing carpentry, gardening, hiking through brush, working in the kitchen, etc. and I cannot tell you how many times I've caught the cord on something and yanked the 'buds out of my ears or the jack out of its socket and yet I've had only one failed set of these earbuds after over a months(!) of daily use. I have stepped on one or the other of the buds at least three times, cracked the 'bud cases twice and after an application of super-glue, they worked as if nothing had ever happened. Alas, after all of this brutal treatment, the left 'bud stopped producing sound, so I finally had to pull my unopened, three-month-old backup set out of my sock drawer.Just lucky with the one pair of 'buds? I don't think so -- I have the same brand and model earbuds on my secondary mp3 player which I've used nearly as much under harsh conditions for over two months and they're still performing great. I'm a frugal (read 'cheap") and active guy who hates buying expensive earbuds, only to have to replace them within three to a months. (If it were illegal, I would have been convicted of bud-abuse months ago.)So here you have these this brand earbuds that are comfortable, affordable, sound good, and are very durable. What more could a person ask for in a set of earbuds for daily use?‚Äù"",1
"‚ÄúA great unit giving decent sound, but what i like best about it is the size, its small and easy to carry and perfect for outdoors‚Äù",1
"‚ÄúGreat speaker for the price! I love the bass on this speaker! May not be to loud but its not bad at all. I personally am satisfied with me purchase. I would definitely recommend this for someone who wants a good speaker without spending so much money‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúI really didn't expect too much from these headphones seeing as they are so cheap but I was so, so wrong. These headphones are incredible. I have owned several pairs of headphones in the past (in ear and around the ear) and believe it or not, these sound so much better. Right after I opened the box I spent like two hours just scrolling through my ipod and listening to random songs with these headphones and then the Bose and these consistently sounded better‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúTo say I'm blown away is putting it mildly. Now, maybe this means I've just had rotten luck 'til now, but prior to this set, every budget pair of earbuds I've tried, (¬£10-15 range), has left me frustrated and sorely disappointed: I've gotten thin and tinny sound with no bass, or muddy sound with no trebble AND no bass... Often barely a step up from the free set on the airplane. I've spent 4 times the cost of these on a skullcandy pair that proved entirely unlistenable. I'd nearly abandoned hope of a worry-free set I could batter in my usual merciless way and still ENJOY listening to. And then, I gave it just one more try...Now, they don't exactly look expensive, and I'll never claim these sound just like my beloved Klipsch or Audiofly earbuds: anyone expecting that from six pound earbuds needs a quick reality check. BUT, I'm also not about to shove those Klipsch and Audiofly investments into a jacket pocket every time I'm racing out the door, (dropping them repeatedly), or leave them on during naps, or say, have them anywhere in view when my audiophile cat is in the mood to examine the wires with her teeth. What the this brand does is offer sound that's crisp and dynamic enough to be properly enjoyed, with a pretty comfortable design, and at a price so affordable -- and so far below anything remotely comparable -- that the cat can have her own set if she wants it.its just plain impressive‚Äù",1

"‚ÄúThe sound is great for me.What amaze me is that you can own pairs of decent sound dual drive earbuds with this price.Sure, these earbuds are really a good choice,absolutely crystal clear sound brings better performance than my original apple earpod.For the dual drive design,I have to say it brings great sound quality for different styles of music.For the middle and the treble part,it perform better than those cheap earbuds,you definitely can enjoy ultra clear audio with this decent earbuds;For the bass,have to say its ok and can cover my needs(I don't like some kinds of music which is noisy).Beside,the earbuds is well made.the metal shell combined with silicone earbuds can distinguish the earbuds from the cheap rough one.The rounded edges design looks beautiful,also fit with my ears very well.Have to say this earbuds is worth to buy,would like to recommend it.‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúWhy bother to write a review about this products? Because I did not experience any of the primary negatives:1. Poor quality sound: I did not find this to be true. The sound quality and volume varies according to the device they are plugged into due to variations in the impedance of the device.These are 16 ohm impedance earbuds designed for portable devices that do not have a lot of power. If under- or over-powered the quantity and quality of the sound will suffer. I plugged them into my laptop and listened via VLC: no issues; into my custom PC with Logitech 5-1 sound system: no issues; into my Moto: no issues; into my Fire HD and Fire 7: no issues. As far as my ear is able to tell, the advertised frequency response of 20-20kHz is as claimed.2. There was one review that said these buds did not work with a cellphone case. Apparently the reviewer does not realize that, on the black market",one can purchase special cases that will permit these buds to work. The secret is to buy a
"case that is designed for your phone so that it permits access to all of the ports and camera lenses.3. Poor quality: these appear to me to be of a better quality that the 3-pair for ¬£10 earbuds that I have been using for the past a months so I anticipate they will last at least as long. But, I just bought these so I cannot say.4. Uncomfortable: this I really do not understand, especially 'after 5 minutes. These earbuds come with three earpieces: 1.3cm, 1.15cm, and 1.0cm by my measurements. I chose the earpieces that give me a firm enough fit that they do not fall out. Over the past hour or so, I have been wearing these and have no issues. I suppose if one employs the largest earpieces and jams them in as far as the tympanic membrane, they might prove uncomfortable.For me, these are great: good sound, good comfort, good price. Oh, and BTW, I am the Lithuanian.Ed‚Äù",0
"‚ÄúThese are some great little earbuds! Sound isolation is good and audio quality is better then expected for the low price. My music sounds very nice and I have absolutely no complaint about that. Jack is the 90-degree elbow variety, as opposed to the straight kind. Keep that in mind if you have a specific need for one type or the other. Comes with 3 different cap sizes that attach securely. I went back and forth a few times to get the right size and the caps are still tight. Nothing I hate more than losing the rubber cap on a perfectly good set of headphones! The only complaint I could have with these is that the cord is a little short. I am 5'11" and the cord barely reaches the mp3 player in my pants pocket. However, this makes for a nice little compact package when wrapped up so it is not that bad at all. I would recommend buying these all day long‚Äù"",0
"‚ÄúJust received the headphone. The used material is really good. Also the sound is very good. The bluetooth connection worked also quickly with the english guide. Untill so far very OK!",1
