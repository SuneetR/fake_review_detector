"Comprises of all the fundamentals necessary at a university level",1
"The book has lucidly described the very basics of astronomy. The fundamental concepts are discussed in clear cut and with unambiguous notion. Mathematics has been used wherever necessary. The overall rating is very good and is worth buying.",1
"This is an excellent review of many important topics of Astronomy. Some astronomy resources can be too elementary and suffer from lack of rigor, while some resources for astrophysics and cosmology can be poorly written (terrible explanations of topics) and very daunting. This Schaum’s Outline for Astronomy by Stacey Palen is well-written, with excellent and succinct explanations of sometimes difficult topics. Illustrations throughout the book support the concepts that are covered and the calculations are well-explained and accessible. Five stars. Definitely recommended for students of astronomy!",1
"Could do with an update regarding recent discoveries, but excellent otherwise!",1
