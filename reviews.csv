"The book has lucidly described the very basics of astronomy. The fundamental concepts are discussed in clear cut and with unambiguous notion. Mathematics has been used wherever necessary. The overall rating is very good and is worth buying.",1
"This is an excellent review of many important topics of Astronomy. Some astronomy resources can be too elementary and suffer from lack of rigor, while some resources for astrophysics and cosmology can be poorly written (terrible explanations of topics) and very daunting. This Schaum’s Outline for Astronomy by Stacey Palen is well-written, with excellent and succinct explanations of sometimes difficult topics. Illustrations throughout the book support the concepts that are covered and the calculations are well-explained and accessible. Five stars. Definitely recommended for students of astronomy!",1

"I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. The product images were very misleading; the jewelry was shown in a beautiful jewelry box, but it arrived in cheap mini-pocket bags. The packaging was absolutely ridiculous and unworthy of the price I paid. To make matters worse, not all the earrings and necklaces displayed in the picture were included in the delivery, which feels like a total rip-off. The quality of the items I did receive was shockingly poor—they look nothing like the images and feel very low quality. I expected much better and am not happy with this purchase at all. I would not recommend buying from this seller",1

"It’s a very nice item fits perfectly. The shoelaces don’t come attached. You have to put them but overall they’re so nice and they come with like a little screw so if anything happens or if the wheels come off, you can tighten them or you can put them back overall it’s so nice",1
"this is the worst item that I ever bought. it does not stick at all. I DO NOT RECOMMEND",0

"This chopper by pigeon is one of the worst and most hopeless chopper available. I wasted my money completely. My sister bought a small size I bought 900ml both stopped working on the very first day. Since I had used a similar chopper from a different company I knew how to repair. I opened the top and saw that they have used a third class plastic material. Do not buy this chopper from Pigeon!!",1
"The quality of the plastic is good and the chopepr does its job well, providds very finely chopped veggies but the only drawback is that after few uses, the string loses its winding capability, also there is no replacement option, just return option is available",1
"Very useful product. Go for it",1
"I recently purchased the Nutri Pro Bullet Blender, and it has quickly become an essential part of my kitchen routine. The quality of this blender is top-notch. its made with durable materials that feel sturdy and well-constructed, ensuring it can handle daily use without any issues.Ease of use is another standout feature. The simple design makes it incredibly user-friendly, even for those who aren't very tech-savvy. Just twist, blend, and you're done! It’s also easy to clean, which is a big plus for anyone with a busy schedule.What really impressed me is how versatile this blender is. Whether I'm making smoothies, grinding nuts, or even preparing soups, the Nutri Pro handles it all with ease. The powerful motor ensures everything is blended to perfection, leaving no chunks behind.Overall, I highly recommend the Nutri Pro Bullet Blender to anyone looking for a reliable, high-quality blender that is easy to use and delivers great results every time",0
"The Nutri Pro Juicer, mixer blender is a very great product. It’s more than what I expected in the price range. It’s easy to put together, use, and clean. When there was issue that occurred, I raised a complaint, and the service team responded quickly. This appliance has become an integral part of our kitchen. I’ve been using this product from preparing morning juice to lunch and dinner purée preparations. It’s been 3 months since I’ve been using Nutri pro and I am very satisfied with the product",0
"I have ordered this product for my friend as a gift. She was happy with the product as it worked fine. Smoothies, chutneys, juices all can be made in it easily. However, the product stopped working within one and a half month. Thankfully, the customer service provided by them was quick and helpful. They immediately replaced the blender. It has been 15 days since replacement. Things are working fine now. Will update the status of this review again if it is not working. If I don't update it, just understand that I am happy with the product and it is working fine since then. However, the only thing I don't like about this product is the quality of small jar. I don't know why but the small jar has started becoming opaque instead of transparent, which it originally was. The quality of bigger jar and glass-like container is intact. And, it has been hardly 2 and half months since I brought the product",1
"Quality is amazing. Been using this mostly for fruit juices since about 2 months now and it works great. Initially I thought the 1 min continuous running time limit would be a limitation but I never really needed even more than 30secs continuous use.I bought the 3 jar model, thought I'd get 3 grinder sets but one of the jar only got a sipper.The dry grinder also worked well to make masala.Would have given 5 stars if there was a multi speed setting.Overall a good buy. Definitely worth it",1
"I've been using the ATOM Digital Kitchen Food Weighing Scale for a few weeks now, and its an absolute game-changer for my cooking and fitness routine. The scale is incredibly accurate, allowing me to measure ingredients to the gram, which is essential for both baking and maintaining a balanced diet. The sleek design fits perfectly in my kitchen, and its super easy to clean. The display is clear and easy to read, even when weighing in larger bowls or plates",0
"Poor quality…didn’t start up on pressing. The batteries provided were puffed up and not fitting in the slot. Even new batteries found it difficult and didn’t start with new set of batteries",1
"Given these features, I had high expectations for its performance. However, upon using the product, I encountered a major defect. The display often flickers and sometimes doesn't turn on at all, making it impossible to get any readings. When the display does work, the weight measurements are inconsistent and vary wildly even with the same object placed multiple times. I weighed the same item, only to receive different readings each time. This inconsistency renders the product useless for any serious measurement tasks.The plastic casing feels cheap and flimsy, and the buttons are not responsive. After only a few weeks of light use, the weighing platform has already started showing signs of wear and tear",1
"I ordered the set because I previously had a similar one from another firm, a very useful thing in the kitchen. The box was crumpled, but the product itself was intact, instructions on the box. It looks good, I hope it will last a long time",1
"The lights are quite good and bright. The quality of the string lights is commendable, perfect for both indoors and outdoors. The installation was pretty straightforward. The length is also quite generous allowing for flexible and creative decorating. The warm glow is perfect for creating a cozy ambience. Highly recommended",1
"So far I have placed order 🛒 for festive lights 🕯️ from 4 different brands/sellers. Destinct than the rest, the DesiDiya box is so beautiful 😍 that it is Gift Worthy. Instead of gifting a box full of sweets (Soanpapdi 😂) to health/diabetes 🍬 conscious recipient, do consider this product as an option as well",1
"Wast of money",0
"The product looks amazing and fits perfectly. You get a tool inside the box for adjusting the strap length according to your convenience. The battery backup is good (but not 7 days as advertised, its like 3 to 4 days max. on average use). I don't use it for fitness tracking, so I won't say much about that, but it has a lot of those features though. Bluetooth calling is great, very good sound and mic quality for a watch. Overall, a 4 out of 5 for the watch.Now when it comes to the app associated with it, which is the NoiseFit app, it sucks a bit. I had continuous connectivity issues from the beginning. The initial setup somehow works fine, but once you get disconnected from Bluetooth, it is impossible to reconnect again (at least on my phone). The only way to reconnect is to unpair from the app (which also doesn't work), unpair the watch from your device settings, reset the watch, uninstall the app, again reinstall the app and start over everything again. Yes, that's what you have to do. And the customer service also sucks, why the hell do you need 3 WORKING DAYS to just respond to the complaint ticket? Even after responding they couldn't solve my issue for another 4 days. Then I just decided to give up on them and tried resetting my entire smartphone, and IT STILL DOESN'T GET SOLVED. So, I start over again and decided to never turn off Bluetooth. its been fine until now at least. Overall app and customer service rating, 2 out of 5",1

"I have installed them behind the glass panes of our sit out in January 24. In just 8 months the wire is completely corroded and broke into pieces. The life of the string in open areas under the roof is very little. They may last longer inside home",1
"This blender changed my life! I used to struggle with making smoothies in the morning, but now I can blend anything in seconds. It even handles frozen fruits like a champ. Plus, the self-cleaning feature is a game changer!",0
"The QuantumFlex Blender 3000 is almost perfect. It blends everything smoothly, but the lid is a bit tricky to get on and off. Other than that, it’s a solid blender with lots of cool features.",1
"This blender isn’t worth the price. It struggles with anything tougher than a banana, and I’ve had to unclog it several times. It looks nice on the counter, but that’s about it. I wouldn’t recommend it",1
"The QuantumFlex Blender 3000 has revolutionized my mornings. I can make my green smoothies in less than a minute, and they turn out perfectly smooth every time. The auto-clean function is a lifesaver, and it’s surprisingly quiet!",0
"It is a good product. Very sturdy and strong tapes. Only problem is once you stick it you can’t remove it from that place and than that its a very good product.",1
"Good product",0
"The adhesive wont even hold 600 gms.. it will come off an fall. I used it for 30 days and it fell off. i cleaned the surface and there was n o moisture even then it was not sturdy enough. Money waste. I cannot even return it now.",1
"The product is good, worth for money and easy to use",0
"Good wire quality good lighting performance, easy to use, good length and nice colour but I bought 3 light and the plug was faulty it sometimes work and sometimes doesn't because of this I have to fit a new plug for light",1
"After installating it in room, and using it for only 3,4 hours daily, it stopoed working. its seems to be made of cheap material and even when I used it with care, did not strech or stress the wire, it still stopped working. Not a good experience.",1
"I liked it so much",0
"The fabric is waterproof and feels good",0
"The durability and its water resistance makes the product smoother and leakage proof. Really loving this product.",0
"This is not very much good product, blending is difficult and tedious process, the one who does not know make-up much or is least interested please donot buy, i thought this would be easily blendable but unfortunately its too much time consuming...I would not recommend this ..also color is cheap like 20 rupees local lipstick...I tried to wash from my hand you can see pinkness yet",1
"I've been through countless moisturizers, but Swiss Beauty Cream has finally become my go-to! its a game-changer for my dry skin.",0
"The packaging is sleek and attractive, making it a nice addition to my bathroom vanity.It feels luxurious to apply, like a spa treatment at home.Overall, I'm highly impressed with Swiss Beauty Cream. its effective, gentle, and affordable. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a daily moisturizer that delivers lasting hydration and a healthy glow!",0
"This hair growth serum is a standout product for anyone struggling with thinning hair. Infused with biotin, rice water, and 3% Redensyl, it delivers powerful results. The biotin strengthens hair from the roots, while rice water nourishes and conditions, making hair softer and more manageable. Redensyl, known for its effectiveness in reducing hair loss, actively promotes new growth, making your hair look fuller and healthier over time. The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly, making it easy to incorporate into your daily routine. Consistent use can noticeably reduce hair fall and boost growth, giving you thicker, stronger hair.",0
"This product is a total waste it claims to stop hairfall and promote hair growth but its of no use...I have consistently used it and infact it gave me severe hairfall don't know why its still in market",1
"The product is working its just for hair growth not to prevent hair fall as I still have hairfall as usual but it make my few hair grey so that's the side effect of using it and it also make my hair rough so not recommended using this product",1
"I love this product, it makes my hair shiny and strong... I have suffered severe hairloss due to pcod, and this product is one of the many products that I use, I must tell you that its worth it, it made my baby hairs grow really fast and is very easy to use. I will update after a few months",1
"Fake and duplicate product. No refund option as well.",0
"I hooked this up to my wife's computer yesterday and almost sent it back DOA. I hit the power button on the back several times and it wouldn't turn on. I even checked to make sure there was power in the end of the plug that goes into the monitor. As I was fussing with it, my wife came over and hit some of the other buttons on the back such as brightness, contrast, etc. and it came to life! I find that strange & pretty much unacceptable. After it started showing the home screen and browsing a bit we didn't think the color was all that great. It had a too bright look to it. After messing with the brightness and contrast we have it looking better (let's say acceptable), but certainly not great or even very good. For a better inexpensive monitor I'd recommend checking out a comparable Spectre monitor. Not recommended for a number of reasons.",1
"Using it for the past 2 months, good for skin, not harsh, not bad as it doesn't put any negative effect on your natural skin, but it doesn't improve my oily skin yet. My skin is not very oily but it is the same as with my previous product and it doesn't help to fade any acne scars till now.",1
"I've been using Dettol Original Germ Protection Bathing Soap Bar for years, and it never disappoints! This soap is a staple in our household, and for good reason. its incredibly effective at killing 99.99% of germs, which gives me peace of mind, especially during cold and flu season",0
"The highlighter came all broken and all the 4 different shades of highlighter were broken into pieces and mixed together. It is a huge mess even the mars box is covered in highlighter. Need a refund asap…!!",1
"Such gorgeous shades it has I've been using it in multiple ways just amazing I would love to use only highlighter of Mars not any other brand.",0
"I got this palette for my sister. And she loved it. Even I'm using it too and its actually good at this rate.",1
"Here is a 30-word review of Park Avenue Cool Blue:Refreshing, calming fragrance for everyday wear. Light, cool scent perfect for summer. Decent longevity, affordable price. Great for casual use, a nice addition to your fragrance collection",0
"I have been using this product for almost a month. It has good aroma and it smells for ling hours like more than 15 hours if you don’t sweat more.one important thing for me I would like to bring here is that it didn’t help me to reduce darkness of my underarms. From the smelling point of view, I would say it’s a best. But it lacks in getting rid of pigmentation.",1
"This book is fantastic. I gained a lot of knowledge from it. This book has a positive impact on life's thinking patterns. It also aided me in facing and conquering my fears.",1
"its perfect read for children as well as for adults. the book got delivered in perfect condition. coming to the book its the first book of harry potter series and whoever likes harry potter movie will love reading it and wont want to put the book away...the best part is you will fall more with harry potter...happy reading potter heads",1
"Just finished reading this book, and to be honest did't found it that much helpful.I mean few chapters are really interesting and good but few are literally boring, feels like the authors was going into too much detail.",1
"This Cooling soap provides a refreshing cleanse with its minty-cool sensation. Its unique formula leaves skin feeling revitalized and thoroughly clean, perfect for hot summer days or after a workout. The antibacterial properties of Dettol ensure thorough germ protection, making it a reliable choice for daily hygiene. Overall, a refreshing and effective soap option for staying cool and clean.",0
"I enjoyed reading the book. I like authors thoughts and her writing process. Every story has a hidden moral that you realize n get a connected. But I was a little disappointed as the name of the book n story of devadasi was opener to the book. I was expecting that stories are all based on different devadasi’s there personal life and how they felt etc but what I was expected wasn’t there the subject jumped from place to place. Though I jumped but I did enjoyed the read",1
"Excellent product with great quality and perfect for daily use it glows the skin and protect from taking good product value for money",0
"Excellent product. Highly recommended for men who like to enhance their facial tone.",0
"The collection has variety of nice smelling fragrances. its good and budget friendly",0
"I had bought the luxury set for Women. All the four perfumes smell awesome and unique. They are long lasting",0
"I loved the product because of the lasting fragrance. But the issue is out of 4 bottes one fragrance is always half empty its mostly with rose fragrance or glam fragrance. This time is Glam fragrance. Then why are we paying for the full amount if we are always receiving half empty bottles.",1
"Perfect. Very comfortable sole. Easy to wear. Long lasting",0
"The product quality is good but heels are narrow and really difficult to walk. mostly your feet gets twisted.",1
"I am extremely happy to use this slipper. Good fit. Extra soft. A good companion!",0
"Comfortable but too soft. Slippery when wet.",1
"Worth the price. Is stylish and quality of the shoes is top notch. Fit is perfect as shown. Thickness of the sole is high. Shoes seems to durable. The color of the shoes are eye catching.",0
"This pair of slippers are nothin great. The pressure points hardly give any pressure. Though it isnt expensive but I guess it still should have been 100₹ cheaper. However, they are ok to wear, comfortable and feels good but a big zero for the pressure points marketing gimmick, though I fell for it",1
"Truthfully I ordered this to serve as an emergancy kit fot the car. After receiving it, I naturally poked around inside and I must say I was please. It was exactly as described, well stocked and ready to roll. After adding a couple minor things like a good knife. It is sett and ready to go for just about any reason. I'm looking to get a second kit when they've restocked",1
"these blades are sharp,sharp. don't have no problem with these blades and just think 2 sets for the price of one set that come in a yellow package. will purchase more when needed. quickshipping",1
"Sweetener in diet sodas. Not good or healthy for you at all.",1
"Had been looking for grapefruit flavored soda for a while and came across Ice. Tasted great, so I started purchasing different flavors. Some are great, some are ok, and some I don’t care for. My go-to flavors are black cherry, black raspberry, grapefruit, and any of the lemonades/limeades. The new grape raspberry is on order and guessing I’ll like it too. But why is ICE bottled in 17 oz containers when the rest of the beverage world uses 16 oz?",1
"My husband loves these ice drinks. Doesn’t drink much diet soda but is diabetic, so he finds this a nice alternative to water or soda for a treat. His favorite flavors are cherry, black raspberry, kiwi strawberry, and cherry limeade. We buy about 3 cases a month from this seller. Cheaper here compared to the big box store. At the store, they’re at least $1 each, but normally $1.25, so this is a better buy. Plus, I get to skip a trip to the store and carrying heavy bags. But overall, much cheaper and convenient to buy the case.",1
"Ordered the same Sparkling Ice, which used to be green and had a less tart flavor. But did the company change both the color and flavor?",1
"Liked this variety pack better than the last one. All flavors were acceptable, with Peach Nectarine and Pink Grapefruit being the best. Black Cherry and Coconut Pineapple were not as good as they sounded. Still waiting for the perfect combo.",1
"This variety pack has some tastier flavors of Sparkling Ice. My husband thinks anything with lemon tastes like janitor in a drum -> but the limeade is okay. My family likes it, and I’m fine with them drinking it in moderation. It has artificial colors, flavors, and sucralose. Also has vitamins and green tea extract, and the bottles are BPA-free. A bit of a mixed bag, but good in a household where we’re eliminating aspartame and trying to cut down on caffeine.",1
"This is their newest flavor and it’s fabulous. Not as sweet as ginger ale, but sweet enough with a delicate touch of lime. Perfect!",1
"First adventure in taste titillation with this gift of a thirst-quenching, body-nourishing, energy-giving, refreshing, tasty, effervescent elixir. The formula was likely given to the company by space aliens who didn’t want Americans to suffer with overly sugary, caloric empty-calorie brown bubbly water. Sparkling Ice refreshments have 0 calories. The black cherry taste was tart and sweet but not overly sweet. Your taste buds adapt readily to the sucralose, and it becomes craveable! No caffeine, instead 50 mg of Green Tea, so your metabolism is humming away. More? B vitamins and D vitamins. Carbonation is just right!!! Though I love plain cold water, this is now one of my daily go-to liquid libations from top-secret aliens... :') Don’t let your lack of belief in aliens stop you from trying this fine product. I’m a Diet Coke nut, and this comes close to my love for Diet Coke while helping me stay hydrated and rev up my metabolism.",0
"Tried several flavors and like the Black Raspberry one best. Some are just OK, and some leave a bad carbon aftertaste. Everybody likes different flavors, so I won’t assume you’d like the same ones I do. The flavor is stronger than most flavored waters I’ve tried, which I like because with most, you can barely taste any flavor. I’d prefer the berry tastes without the CO2, though. CO2 levels make me belch during and after finishing a bottle. There’s more CO2 than in sodas I drank. Good quantity of liquid in each bottle, so one bottle goes farther than a soda can but a bit less than a Gatorade bottle. Bottles are slim and tall with non-flat bases, so they easily tip over and spill. Needs a flatter bottom and should be shorter to hold the fluid without tipping over. More like a Gatorade 20 oz bottle. Several flavors have a strong aftertaste of carbon, probably from the CO2. Some flavors' carbon taste is more noticeable than others. Slight recommendation for taste and strong recommendation for healthiness as opposed to sodas. Advise new purchasers to buy a variety pack first, as judging by one flavor isn’t fair. Bought different flavors of these several times from Amazon and locally when stocked.",1
"Absolutely LOVE Sparkling ICE!!! Helps boost H2O consumption, gives me a little flavor, and, because I get several 'flavors,' adds variety to my day! I have to choose my flavors for my own 'variety' packs because everyone always puts strawberry something in there. While strawberries won’t kill me, they make my GI system extremely uncomfortable. ICE uses natural flavors, so I choose the ones without strawberry - Black Cherry, Cherry Limeade, Blueberry Pomegranate, Lemonade, Mango Orange, etc. All are delicious!!! My grandson even thinks they’re wonderful - he didn’t realize they were water until someone told him! This is the way to do it!",1
"Sparkling Ice, Ginger Lime Sparkling Water, with antioxidants and vitamins, Zero Sugar, is a new flavor that’s both delicious and refreshing. Ginger and lime are among my favorite flavors, and it’s the perfect drink during hot summer months. Ginger is the predominant flavor with a good boost of lime, and it really hits the spot. The sparkling water is fortified with vitamins and antioxidants and has zero calories, so no guilt. Comes in a pack of 12 - 17 FL OZ Bottles and is easy to store. Each bottle contains two servings, but I must confess, I can polish off a whole bottle when really thirsty in this heat. Very pleased to have found this beverage and recommend it when you want something cold and tasty to drink. Give it a try.",1
"Absolutely love Ice water. Always been an avid Dr. Pepper drinker (as are many from the mid-South). its an Oklahoma/Texas thing to do and so unhealthy. Endocrinologist said I absolutely shouldn’t drink soda any longer due to the carbs. Told to try Perrier for carbonation, but that didn’t do it for me, so I just cheated, telling myself there are worse habits. A friend turned me on to Ice water but warned that she bought it by the crate at Sam’s and felt it was probably costly. She was right. Found it at Big Lots for $.75 each, but it was burdensome to buy that way, and you could never be sure what was in stock. Then came the Pandemic. Dr. ordered me to stay home and have groceries delivered. Personally, I like the original flavors delivered here. Best price I’ve found. I can count on them being delivered to my door, packaged neatly in a tight plastic wrap that fits perfectly in a box. Sometimes, due to carbonation, I worry about them spewing out like sodas often do. It starts to fizz up when I turn the top, but always goes back down. Amazing in this 100+° heat. Imagine the temps it reaches in those trucks. Grateful for this water, delivered safely to my door at a very reasonable price. Thank you.",1
"This stuff is crack. My boyfriend and I have tried every flavor of Sparkling Ice, and this Strawberry Watermelon flavor stands out. Been ordering three 12-packs a month for at least the past two and a half years and still not sick of it. It’s the only soda or sparkling drink we have. Balances both flavors well and is guilt-free. Relatively inexpensive, especially if you do Subscribe & Save as we do. Easily stack the 12-packs in a closet for a small footprint. Unrelated to the product, appreciate that all three arrive in one box that my poor postman lugs up a flight of stairs (don’t worry, I tip him each year).",1
"These were exactly what I was looking for! I was using disposable and they were twice as hot. They are super comfortable and soft and dip at the cheekbones like I wanted.",1
"These are the best masks I’ve found! I ordered the XL size to fit my ample dome. I have a HUGE face and my beard only exacerbates things. Hat size 7 5/8”, beard is usually 5-6” off my chin. How HUGE is your face if these masks are too small? You must be a cartoon or some sort of animated caricature. These masks would fit Jay Leno’s chin! These masks would cover Adrian Brody’s big ol’ honker! These masks would even fit OJ Simpson’s gargantuan noggin! Great buy, and I would buy again!",0
"I’ve been through about 6 masks now and I’ve FINALLY found comfort and breathability. If I have to wear a mask, it’s got to be comfortable! I’m an essential worker in a warehouse but also am out and about quite a bit and I needed a reusable and washable safety mask. First of all, this mask is so soft, and secondly, it is 3 PLY which gives great protection as well...BUT the real value prop with this mask is the ear loops. The loops that come off this mask are circular and elastic and very comfortable. The previous masks I used had square-shaped elastic bands that went behind my ears which were incredibly uncomfortable and gave me Dumbo ears (not a good look). I also like that it’s a three-pack. I did purchase an XL because I have a beard and a larger face, it’s nice they have a size chart in their images and a few different sizes, this one is good you won’t be disappointed!",1
"I like that these masks fit really comfortably on my face. I don’t feel like its squishing my nose, but it also has a decently tight fit. It also doesn’t pull on my ears like a previous one that I had. I know it isn’t the time to care about these things...but I looked seriously ridiculous with my ears poking out! They are made of really nice 3 PLY fabric, very happy with this.",1
"I have a pretty fat face, so I have trouble buying one-size-fits-all masks, but these fit very well. I can talk or open my mouth normally without it sliding off my nose or chin. The tapered nose fits well and doesn't leave a huge gap (I also have a honker of a nose). The fabric is soft and comfortable, doesn't feel suffocating. I washed in a lingerie bag on warm, and then tumble-dried on medium, and there was no shrinkage or damage. No unpleasant smell or feel. Would buy again.",1
"I have a big head and usually need an XL hat. These masks fit perfectly and feel very nice. Even if your head is a little smaller, these will fit fine and not kill your ears. Very recommended.",1
"These are the pictures of the extra large size. I hope this helps determine the correct size to order. The mask covers my nose and mouth perfectly. The elastic loops keep it snugly in place. The loops are not adjustable. The inside and outside fabrics are soft and lint-free.",1
"Bought these for my husband (pictured). We have been looking for something to fit his face. He said they have minimal fogging effect on his glasses. He’s happy with the product.",1
"Very flexible. The material is breathable enough that I don't feel like I am suffocating. The shape is also really good and it fits over my face very well. I definitely recommend washing them first thing, it helps them fit better and I found they can shrink a bit for a tighter fit on the face. They also are easy to pack up and take on the go, and I like the color. its very simple and sleek and is super useful.",1
"These masks are awesome and they are made really well... these will be great for when I go back to work or need to go to the grocery store.",1
"I just got the XL face masks in. They could still use to be a bit bigger. The nose section will come off when talking/yawning and the elastic is a bit of a stretch to get around your ears and feels quite thin. These are still going to hurt to wear for long stretches, but better than any other option that I've tried. If you have a big head/face, this is probably your best bet.",1
"Wow, the fit and quality of these masks are incredible. They are sturdy yet breathable and the fit is awesome... no more weird issues with masks falling down my nose when I talk. I love that they have anti-microbial properties too. Finally, someone got it right with this mask.",1
"I like that they have 3 different sizes. I ordered the large and it fits very comfortably without wanting to slide up or down my face while talking. They are made from a very soft material, and you can feel the 3 layers of fabric in it. The elastic loops for the ears are very stretchy and long enough that you don't get any pull on your ears.",1
"The masks are SO comfortable and breathable. They’re obviously not the same kind of protection as a surgical mask, but if you need one to run errands, it’s so perfect!",1
"Great Product... Stretchy mask and thick protective mask...I will buy again.",1
"NOT Covid-19 Mask... These masks 'might' help with mowing or painting.. 'might'!! However, these are NOT for covid-19.. I should have read MORE!! The weave is too large in these, to be small enough for CV-19.. they have to be 0.3... These are just a 'for looks' mask! They are soft, comfortable, and breathable.. BUT the entire reason for purchase was CV-19... We will keep them; hubby will paint or mow with them!",0
"EnerPlex Premium Extra-Large Reusable Face Masks (set of 3) are considerately manufactured, consisting of fine quality material, durable stitching, inclusive of well-fitting ear bands. Said face masks offer properly proportioned dimensional contouring for larger men's facial structure coverage, exceptional, overall, comfort and breathability. Indeed, the masks fit my face as if custom-made, and they are sufficiently compatible with eyeglass wearers even in quite warm settings.

Yes, I am very satisfied with EnerPlex Premium XL Face Masks, and will soon place additional orders. Highly recommended purchase, from a proven truly honorable marketplace seller, to assist in essential health maintenance during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease pandemic. Let's all join in staying, and keeping one another, protected, safe, healthy, and happy. Hope my product review serves as helpful in my fellow customers' buying decision.",0
"I have looked at, purchased, and returned several masks (or given them away) because NOTHING ever fits right... These do, and they are pretty comfortable as well. The elastic is a little less stretchy, but I can put these on and talk without having to pull them up every 2 words. Covers everything that needs to be covered and stays put, thank you!",1
"These masks are great. Excellent quality, leave you room to breathe and yet they are thick enough to protect you. I believe it could be a little thicker, actually, but it should do the trick. I am a 5.1 female and I got medium after reading a few reviews. I believe I could have gotten the small ones, as it feels a bit loose on my face. For reference, I have a thin, oval face and weigh 103 pounds.",1
"I purchased the small size for my 11-year-old and it fits perfectly. Not too tight that it’s pulling at the ears but definitely not leaving gaps. Material is thick but stretchy. For reference, she’s definitely on the small side, but overall, I think this could comfortably fit kids that are a little older.",1
"Alright, adult here with a teeny tiny head! Don’t laugh, but my favorite baseball hat is a 5T, so my head is NOT adult-sized. I ordered the small and it fits perfectly! I was desperately in need of a mask that I could wear during my CrossFit workouts and this wins! I don’t suck in cloth when working out and it stays put on my face without falling down or creeping up into my eye sockets. I ordered three more since I absolutely must wash them after each use. As soon as the white ones are back in stock I’ll order 6 more for work!",1
"It’s hard to believe that these are three-ply masks — they’re very thin. Consequently, it’s hard to imagine that they offer much protection, particularly after they’ve been washed a couple of times. I strongly discourage purchasing these.",0
"The colony has no smell, it has the smell of pure alcohol, it does not have any aroma. I feel cheated by the seller since the colony has no smell. It is not fair to be treated in this way, and I do not return it because it costs me more to send it back. The ideal is to replace it with a real cologne with a good smell.",1
"I've ordered this cologne off of Amazon a few times and I have never been disappointed. I know how it smells and how strong it's supposed to be. Unfortunately, this recent order was a rip-off. The cologne smells the same but is VERY faint. As soon as I spray it, a minute later I can't detect it. It takes a lot more sprays and the cologne is running out quickly. Amazon seriously needs to reconsider returning or at least refunding colognes. There are too many knockoffs/diluted products, and it is not fair for customers. If you can ship it to me, you can ship it back.",1
"I bought all three: The Classic, The Voyage, and The Blue. They all smell good. But in my personal preference, the King of all three is Voyage—The Nautica Voyage. It smells very fancy like a cool ocean, fresh but expensive elegant men’s perfume/cologne, all of the above in layers. For me, using it in 30 degrees February winter, it lasts a very long time (8-12+ hours, more if you use the right amount on you and some light spray on your clothes). You can also go light, and it will last 3-6 hours depending on how much you use. Then in second place is the Nautica Blue; it smells more sweet, like a hint of fruity sweetness, and fancy with tones of a cool and sporty fancy smell—very, very nice. It lasts on me just the same length of time as the Voyage. And in third place, the Classic; it smells nice but it's too musky and woody for my personal taste, as I like it more sweet than woody, but it still smells really good. I can see some older, mature men liking this one better. But the really interesting thing is that when I mix and use equal amounts of both Voyage and Blue together, it creates a really incredible sweet, fruity, very fancy, and expensive fragrance that’s out of this world. It smells like cool oceanic sweet fruity sweet tones like peaches and cream with kind of pineapple hints, something really amazing to describe. I went to my daughter’s female doctor today, and she and also her assistant, who both entered at different times by themselves, mentioned the really amazing smell in the room, lol. Also, my teenage daughter mentioned how great my perfume smelled the day before. And another woman in the elevator said, 'Umm, it smells really good in here,' lol. So to me, it's a winner. Next time I will only buy the Nautica Voyage and the Nautica Blue—a perfect mix.",0
"Was looking for a clean/refreshing fragrance. While I thought about purchasing 'Invictus Aqua,' this was a very cheap alternative with great reviews. So I said, 'why not?'. To my surprise, it has a VERY clean, refreshing scent to it. When you wear this, you bring a wonderful crisp smell into the dull, scentless room! And yes, people notice it too. Received a compliment from a female co-worker the first day I wore it; she asked me what I was wearing. Like I said, it's a nice scent! Scent is A+. Projection lasts about 3-4 hours, afterwards being less strong but still noticeable up close. Total longevity is about 6 hours since it's a light fragrance, not too shabby. Totally recommend. If you don't like it, throw it in the corner. It's too affordable to not at least try first.",0
"Over the years I have tried several different office-use toilette sprays, and to my astonishment, most do not last the entire day. Yesterday, while working in the backyard expanding the HE SHED in Southern California (Inland Empire), I came in for an afternoon rest. The better half (the wife) mentioned if I was wearing cologne. She also said it smells nice and sweet. I was stunned. Why? Sweating and dusty from building materials, I did not expect it to last that long. Well...it not only met my wife's nose but continued the entire day. The cologne is not only a grand bargain (bang for the buck) but also appealing to those with a nose.",1
"I don't know if this is fake, or Nautica just made a poor product. This smells good initially, but the smell is weak and does not last more than 30 minutes. If I spray it in the morning, the scent is gone by the time I have my coffee. Not buying this again.",0
"It doesn't seem to be an original product. Not enough fragrance.",0
"“Great size and value for the price, light crisp airy scent, perfect for the summer, not sure if I would consider it to be a thick fall scent, but definitely fresh and crisp! Longevity has been pretty good; if you apply in the morning and go all day, it will pretty much last you all day. If you happen to be going out at night, apply a few more squirts and you're good to go!”",1

"“First time purchasing a Nautica brand cologne. Had never smelled it before, but I had just run out of my normal everyday cologne. I was looking for something a little different and came across Voyage. It had tons of gleaming reviews and $15 for a 3.4oz bottle was a steal. The smell is very fresh, with hints of fruit and a light musky after smell. I really liked it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the longevity, in my experience, is only about 3 hours. After that, the cologne is hardly noticeable unless you literally have your face where you sprayed it earlier. But hey, for the price, that's to be expected.”",1
"I've bought tons of stuff from Amazon, including cologne. This is only my second review I'm making because this is one incredible deal. Been using different colognes and this one seems to get a lot of good reaction. I am a waiter so of course I like to smell nice, and this cologne has had guests genuinely laughing while telling me I smell so good. My coworkers have all complimented it to an extreme. Cool Water has always been my favorite, but people seem to really like this. I can say it's legit, but it doesn't last forever. I guess it peaks shortly after you put it on and lasts for roughly 5-6 hours before the smell starts to vanish. Overall, for the price... WOW. This cologne is a keeper in my collection as I don't like to wear the same every day. Side note- the bottle and cap are my favorite out of all the colognes I use, very nice job there. Awesome stuff.",1
"Nautica Voyage has a really fresh scent. I don’t really do the whole hints of this and notes of so and so. I'll simply stick to it has a fresh sort of out of the shower clean scent. Nothing is overpowering here; you can give yourself a few sprays and not worry about it suffocating the room. I will say as far as staying power, it holds up for a few hours. After that, it's pretty much non-existent. Really good for just an evening out or something but if you're looking for all-day, maybe not the best choice.",1
"I get this because I'm tired of paying a lot of $$$$ for the expensive brands. Guess what? I've gotten more compliments off of this cologne in ALL my 54 years on the planet. Lol. I would recommend it every time. Let's just say it’s got a fruity, island, beach type smell. I think it’s awesome. I always read comments, and the people who have broken tops—I can see it happening, but it hasn’t happened to me. But you know what, for the price YOU CANNOT BEAT IT. I’ll take a broken top any day. They’re just the type that can’t find the good in anything. Find a cologne that’s less than $20 that’s that BIG OF A BOTTLE. You ain't gonna do it. It’s a great buy, and I’ve bought it twice already. And I will buy it again. Thanks, Nautica. Awesome smell.",0
"One of the classic perfumes that will last forever. This perfume contains an essence that allows you to use it both at night and in the day. My wife ordered it for me and always says how good its aroma is.",0
"I would have to say if you want a cologne that people will compliment but not break the bank, this is the right one for you. Has a clean smell, not overwhelming but stays around all day.",1
"I bought this for me and yes I am a woman. I used to buy Nautica Blue for my ex, and I loved it so much I ended up wearing it. When I went back to buy Nautica Blue, it was out of stock, so I settled for Voyage. I settled well. It is stronger than Blue, very masculine, yet breezy and cool and fits me just fine. I wear it daily to work and dab my little boy in it before heading out the house. He loves when I lift up the bottle to dab it on him, always smiles after. So even though it's for men, I find that it works well with women too... after all, I buy it for myself and I love floral scents.",1
"I didn't know what this smelled like before buying but I know Nautica to be a great brand. The only thing I was worried about was if it was going to be fake or something because that seems to be a problem with fragrances on Amazon. Well, after using it for the first time today... I'd say it's the real deal. I literally just did one little spray on my chest before I left for work. I could smell it just fine pretty much through the whole day. I actually can still smell it, and I have a very physical labor job (shipping industry), and I'd have to say that's pretty amazing. I'm glad I took the risk and would highly recommend this scent to anyone looking for an affordable cologne with a heavenly scent and long-lasting!",0
"I purchased this cologne through Amazon and this is the first time I've tried this particular cologne as I usually go for The Beat by Burberry and this smells great. I put some on after receiving it this morning and now 12 hours later I still smell it on me. I spray a small squirt behind each ear and inside my shirt. You can go as subtle as you want with this if you choose or spray a little extra—either way, it's gonna stick all day long. Very good price for such a good long-lasting smelling cologne. I have no idea why the 1-star reviews are complaining about receiving fake bottles unless purchased through a third party on here; even then, for as cheap as this cologne is to buy, it wouldn't make sense to imitate it. You normally see this happen on more expensive colognes. I have zero alcohol smell, and my bottle came completely sealed in plastic, and the bottle has the metal cap, not the plastic I’ve seen some people talking about.",1
"I used to love this cologne a long time ago, but either the formula is different now or I received a counterfeit bottle. The smell does not smell the same and definitely doesn't last—it just smells watered down and has a fairly strong hint of alcohol. I'm not really sure what to make of that. I should note that the product I received was from 'Notre Dame de Paris Perfumes,' so it's 100% possible they just sold me a bunk knockoff. My mistake for not checking it more thoroughly. I've received legit colognes that were shipped and sold from Amazon themselves, so be sure to double-check who is selling the actual product. If you get the real deal, the cologne itself is a classic for daily wear in the summertime. You could do a lot worse for a $15 cologne.",1
"Not my bag, just too boring and typical. The sort of scent that is like 1000 others in the same price range and makes the ladies walk on by to the guy wearing any scent from Cerruti or Versace. I bought this in the search for a backup everyday scent. Thallium Blue is my starter and still the best, lowest priced men's fragrance one can buy in my humble opinion, if it jives with your body chemistry. I read reviews and had hopes that this might be the one to mix things up a little with the everyday scent, but nothing doing. It might be great for some and get some 5 stars, but I've bought men's fragrances online that had thousands of five-star reviews and smelled like an old lady's perfume. It's a gamble when you buy scent online with no way to check it out first. All you can do is give it a shot and don't spend too much money on anything you haven't checked out at a brick-and-mortar store and confirmed you like. This one you can check out at Walmart, which should say it all with regard to how typical and boring this scent is.",0
"Prepare to get a ton of compliments with this cologne. Smells incredible. I've been purchasing for seven years and still get compliments on how great it smells. I usually do three sprays and it lasts a good three to five hours. The smaller bottle lasts quite a long time with everyday use.",1
"I got this as a Father's Day present for my Dad and gave it to him a day early. You can’t beat the value for the price. If you are a cologne freak like me, you will definitely appreciate this. Yet again, I can’t stress the value for the price. Plus, it is a nice, classic and masculine scent.",1

"Disappointed, where is the company getting this product from? I have been purchasing this product for years and I was able to notice the change of the scent, scent strength, and lasting. In the last 4 products I received, the fragrance is not strong enough as original products. As soon as it is applied to the skin, the aroma is thin and almost gone, in order to really smell the product you need to be really close to the body surface where you applied the cologne (it is like rubbing alcohol with some level of scent). I cannot state that it is FAKE because I am not an expert, but for sure it is not as good as products from other years. My wife was able to tell the difference really quickly and asked me if I changed the type of cologne because for her it was a different product. I confirmed the product differences in the dedicated stores where the 'same' product is available. Value is not the same as products from years ago, I have to use tons of the product to have the same level of scent from me. For my wife, maybe I will need to go and buy it in another place.",0
"Great fragrance but you must spray a ton of it to really project the scent and make it last more than an hour. I’d suggest keeping a travel-sized atomizer with you throughout the day to refresh the scent. Update: it is now my favorite summer scent! Where I thought it died out at the end of the day, I was wrong. My wife still smells it as I walk past. I bumped my review to 4 stars from 3 because it’s my favorite and lasts a long time. But you still need to put a lot on. One spritz on all the vital spots like wrists, inner elbows, collarbone, neck, and sometimes a few extra to really set it in stone. The smell is like fresh-cut watermelon mixed with fresh-cut grass. And those two scents are the best smells in the world to me. So if you love those, you will love this!",1
"I am not too sure what I was sent. Packaging looks legitimate and so does the product. However, the smell of the product is nothing like the authentic cologne. I still have a bit of my authentic spray and my family can smell it from across the room when I spray it even once. However, with the product I received, I can't even smell it and I'm the one wearing it. The scent doesn't stay with you that long. You'll have to carry the bottle with you and keep spraying it on for people to notice you are wearing it if you are going to be out long. It does smell wonderful at first. I actually wondered if I was just getting used to the smell and asked my wife if she could even smell it on me. She had to almost put her nose on my arm to smell it. This will be my one and only time buying Nautica Voyage. I'd love to return it if I can",1
"I don't understand why some people complained about this cologne...it smells amazing and it lasts forever. My fiance put it on at 8 am for church and by 9 pm it still smelled awesome. Of course, the smell of cologne or perfume will fade a bit throughout the day, that is understandable. But this cologne still smells awesome after hours! And the bottle is a big bottle and it does not look cheap or fake. Smell Description: it's not too strong but not too light it has a fresh sport smell kinda like Polo Sport or Axe Sport. It is not a musky smell or smells like something a grandpa would wear. It's something a crisp, sporty, refreshing smell...something like when you smell it you have to ask the person what they are wearing. My finance loves it and I love it more lol! And the bottle is the size of a large bottle of cologne, definitely looks like it's way more than what it costs",1
"This has been my go-to cologne for years now and thought I’d try to buy it on Amazon because it’s cheaper than the store, but as usual it backfired. Luckily I’ve still got some cologne left from the real bottle to compare, and the one I received from Amazon smells like straight rubbing alcohol. Save your money and buy something else, or just buy from the store, only positive was it got here a day early",1

It means the material is capable of posing a risk of safety and property when returning the item. Hazmat items may include aerosol cans, health & beauty items, and home improvement items.' I ordered this, then it was on lightning deal  & so I canceled the 1st order.  Now I'm trying to return it and it says it's not returnable!  How can that be?  What a scam!  BEWARE!",0

"I always loved Michelle Obama.  Her grace and dignity always seemed to come as a gift from above.  Her spirit is so incredibly deep and strong.  The stories from her childhood, her brother, her neighborhood, her family, inform us in a brilliant voice about what it was like in the place and time she grew up. Michelle Obama has the empathy and the depth of character so missing in her media portrayal.  I always felt worried that we were suffocating her.  But there is a Michelle Obama who is bigger than the words on a page.  She knows our pains, and she understands our lives.  And we know her in this book.  In this most private book, we know her in a way we could not have otherwise.  Interesting that nothing here surprises me, it only affirms what I felt like I know:  Michelle Obama is a person like us.  She worked and suffered and overcame. Her storytelling skills are exquisite. It left me a little breathless to hear her voice, unfettered and real. I love the photographs.",0
"Worst piece of crap ever",0
"Michelle Obama is my voice, a voice that may never be heard with thoughts, feelings, and experiences similar to mine yet they don’t matter until now. Thank you Mrs. Obama! For being the voice of this African American woman. Everyone should buy this book!",0
"I read a lot of negative reviews, but I don’t understand why. I enjoyed reading her story from her perspective. Some parts made me sad; however, I’ll always view Michelle Obama as a role model.",0
"This is the most worthless garbage ever put into book form.",0
"A window into her life so far, Michelle Obama gives us endearing, insightful, honest memories. From growing up in a working-class household in Chicago, to leaving the White House residence, her story is unique and thought-provoking. If you admire and respect the Obamas, you will like this book.",0
"Awful!",0
"Self-congratulatory and conveniently missing a few events.",0
"Boring and predictable.  She’s not what a working woman you’d imagine would be portrayed as.  She’s entitled and while she tries to come off as a great American she said she never was proud of this country until... remember?",1
"I enjoyed the entire book. Thank you for writing it!  I truly believe many young girls will read the book and know they can live with honor like you.",0
"Not a good book!",0
"I have to agree with some of the other critical reviews- this book is very self-congratulatory and overall on the dull side. It was hard to get through in its entirety.",1
"The rating is strictly for the production of the book and not the content. I decided to purchase a couple of copies for my mother and me. I have the book on Audible and wanted a hard copy to write notes in. In the picture, you’ll notice that there is a hint of ink on a number of the pages. I took a picture of the following pages for comparison. You can’t read them at all, or some pages are so faint that if you hold a bright light, like the flash of my camera, you can see the print. I’m obviously returning these copies and hoping the replacements don’t turn out the same.",1
"Was a joy to experience Mrs. Obama’s perspective on current events and revelation of her past (and present) life experiences. She’s open, honest, and forthcoming. Fantastic read. You’ll enjoy it.",1
"If you're into leftist PR, this should be your cup of tea. If not, buy the latest sci-fi novel; there’s more truth in there.",1
"I started reading and couldn't put it down, finishing it literally 24 hours after delivery. Michelle Robinson Obama's story is one of challenges met, hard work tempered with good sense, and above all, how a few key people in a life can support a young girl and elevate her so that she, in turn, can elevate others. It is a wonderful, heartfelt, true story of HOPE in a world gone far too cynical.",1
"Self-serving and predictable. Don’t waste the time.",0
"I was amazed reading this book. It tells the unbelievable transition Michelle made to become the First Lady. A great read for the whole family.",0
"Stuck to the book. The reading is so pleasant. Reading the Preface I laughed, got intense, and cried. Can’t wait to continue reading. I love her even more!",0
"I've always been an Independent Voter. I have no bias against Michelle Obama or negativism to say about her role as First Lady. However, I found her book to be grossly arrogant in its content and attempts at self-promotion...the very opposite portrayal of her wish to identify with, 'us ordinary women,' that she tries so hard to convey to her readers. Her latest appearance and comments on 'The Jimmy Fallon Show,' about sending the current First Lady a 'Bye Felicia' wish, was very telling about her lack of truthfulness in her book about always choosing 'to go high,' when she communicates messages to other disagreeing Americans. It was a rude and undignified comment, and I was embarrassed for her. She slipped at that very moment, and the world saw the truth behind the curtain of what type of woman she truthfully is in reality. She owes the current First Lady an apology. I will not recommend this book because of its untruthful representation.",1
"This is a book that is difficult to resist; the writing is sublime. Michelle Obama has a way with words; this is one of the most fascinating and informative books I have read this year. There is a great deal to admire about Michelle Obama. A young woman brought up on the other side of the tracks in Chicago, went to Princeton, and then Harvard for her law degree, and became the First Lady of the United States. Some of her success was due to luck, but most is due to her intelligence and her hard work. As a woman and a Black woman, she had to work three times as hard as a man, and she proved her worth. Michelle Obama tells us she is writing this book to inspire the next generation. She knows how important role models are, especially for young women of color in a culture that isn’t changing fast enough. She says in her book, 'Here I am, I have got a lot to say.' Her book is divided into three sections: 'Becoming Me,' 'Becoming Us,' and 'Becoming More.' What we find in these pages is a woman opening herself and her world to us. This is a book so well written, with such honesty and integrity, I felt like I was trusted with her secrets. She starts by talking about her upbringing, her life in Chicago, a family who showed such love and at the same time showed her that using her intellect to move herself forward was the right path. Off to Princeton where she was a minority for the first time, learning to navigate in a white world. Then to Harvard to study law and her first job, where she met her future husband, Barack Obama. Then the life of a married woman, working full-time, wanting a family and finally succeeding via in vitro fertilization. Her husband was into politics and was often not home, so Michelle was the parent. Some resentment and couples therapy helped them through their rough spots. Political life is difficult, and the statements by some were hurtful, and she names names. The scrutiny and constraints were a lesson she quickly learned and went on to become one of the most beloved First Ladies. Now, Michelle Obama has her real life back, and she is discovering who she wants to be. Malia and Sasha are settling into their lives with plans of their own. Michelle Obama has no love for politics and she will never seek a political office. Michelle, Barack, and the girls are looking toward the future. Michelle Obama is telling the truth of her life; she grew up surrounded by love in a city, Chicago, she loves, onward to an education that took her far. She has everything she wanted, family, a husband she loves, and now she is looking at her next adventure. An autobiography I urge everyone to read. This is a book of the year.",0
"Inspirational and powerful. I loved this book.",1
"This is an interesting, beautifully written book by one of the most admired women in the world. It includes many personal details about Mrs. Obama's background that were new to me and enjoyable to read. The photo section is a highlight. Michelle Obama, thank you for being such a great role model during your time in the White House, advocating for exercise and good nutrition for children, and speaking with grace and courage. We miss you.",1
"I did not enjoy this book. It came across as having a very inflated sense of self. I picked it up from my local library, attracted by its prominent display, but found it rather dull and self-congratulatory. The narrative felt repetitive, and I struggled to stay engaged.",1
"Michelle Obama's rags-to-riches story is gripping and worth reading. The book chronicles her journey from a government housing project in Chicago to the White House, showing her resilience and compassion. It’s a testament to her character and the impact of her work. The book inspires readers to find their voice and believe in themselves. Her honest reflections on race and her candid portrayal of the Obamas' time in the White House add depth to her story. It’s a heartfelt and sincere account.",0
"Bought six copies for a book club. All six had about five pages that were completely blank, and a few pages had faded print. Despite this, the text was still readable.",1
"“Amazing!!!!”",0
"“I thought she did a really good job of showing us the human side of who she and Barack were. If a buddy of yours grew up to become the president or first spouse, and it was sort of a fairy tale, a book like this would show the underside or the real side of the process. Just like *Hillbilly Elegy* by J.D. Vance, this book shows us how some Americans 'make it' from the ground up, but that it’s not easy. Making it is a quicksilver process, requiring such ingredients as intelligence, timing, hard work, luck, and happenstance. It’s scary how many things can impede the chances of good, smart kids. Michelle Obama chronicles how she managed to make it, and she deserved her good fortune, but she would be the first to tell you a lot of it wasn’t up to her. This makes you sad about all the kids left behind, or let’s be honest: all the kids who are murdered before they can fulfill their potential. Obama is frank with kids who’re struggling against the odds, and in this as in so many other issues, she doesn’t get down and helpless over the burdens. She encourages us to accept what is and work around it. I found that empowering. Her description of meeting and getting to know, then falling in love with, Barack is really interesting. It was NOT love at first sight! They became friends, then sweethearts, and then, over time, deeply in love. We get to see what Barack is like—truly, that’s the stellar aspect of this book; it’s so candid! Michelle isn’t afraid to complain and speak honestly; she struggles as a young adult and a working mother, then as a political spouse. You really see the sausage-works of political campaigns. The book wasn’t gripping, but it was interesting. I’ve always thought she was super-smart and clever, and that seems true, but when she mentions she’s not overly introspective, I found that hard to believe. However, by the end of the book, I wondered if it was true because she minimized some events in her life that would have been compelling had she gone deeper. She was the first/only black woman to do X, Y, and Z. I feel quite sure she ran into a lot more obstacles than she shares, and in that sense, she kind of minimizes her astronomical climb. How many kids from the hood get into Princeton and Harvard, and then succeed as well as she did? And when she got hired at the white-shoe law firm, what did that really feel like? Ah, well. A missed opportunity. There is so much to like about this book, the little vignettes about life in the White House, for example. The policy issues were less interesting; the human issues more so. All in all, a worthwhile and enjoyable read.”", 1
"“Never have I ever wished I was illiterate until now. I have read some awful books in my day, but this one takes the cake by far. I will admit, however, I do have a favorite part of this terrible dive into the life of former First Lady Michelle Obama (mad respect by the way; love women, hate terrible books that make me want to rip my eyes out), and that is when I was able to close the back cover and toss this waste of a tree into a dumpster behind a local Long John Silver's. I would have returned this book and asked for a complete refund, but all the silver in the world couldn't give me back the time I wasted reading this tasteless piece of garbage. I support reading!”",1
"“First of all, I’m happy to report that I’m writing this review AFTER I read the book, and it’s not completely based on my past and present political views. With that being said, I didn’t completely love the book. I was expecting Michelle Obama to be a little less guarded in it and go a little deeper into her personal thoughts and struggles; to be a little bit more candid. I also wanted to find out more about life in the White House. On all of those fronts, this book mostly doesn’t deliver. Mrs. Obama is an incredibly intelligent woman, and on top of that, she is a lawyer with an Ivy League education. That background has largely influenced this book, which feels like it’s been edited for any possibility of risky statements or disclosures. It feels too safe, too guarded to really be authentic. She focuses a lot on presenting a very clean version of her life (her family was perfect; it was loving and supportive, her mom was without any faults, her father was equally perfect and he handled his disability with pride and no complaints). Is that realistic? While her family must’ve been quite amazing, and I’m sure she loved it very much, nothing and no one is really perfect. I just couldn’t buy it. For some reason, she barely mentions Harvard. She goes into quite a bit of detail about being a black woman at Princeton, but she dedicates maybe half a page in the book to her time at Harvard, mostly talking about how she didn’t have time to reflect on what she wanted to do in life during the intense studies to obtain her law degree. That’s it. It made me very curious about what happened at Harvard and why she or Harvard itself didn’t want that to be in the book. She is clear about not liking politics and not really wanting to be in politics, but provides very little insight into how she transformed from that stage to seeming to really enjoy being the First Lady (she was terrified Barack Obama wouldn’t be elected for the second term). She mentions very little about her marital struggles. She does say at some point they went to counseling, but again, it’s a brief mention and ends at that. She seems to describe nothing but marital bliss after that. I did appreciate that she mentioned having a miscarriage, having to go through IVF to conceive, failing her bar exam on the first try, and getting into Harvard from a waiting list. But I did notice one thing about the tone of the book: Michelle Obama is determined not to focus on anything negative. She mentions her miscarriage very briefly and almost dismissively by saying that they’re very common and happen to more women than we all think. That again takes about half a page to a full page. Her IVF is mentioned, but again quite briefly. She describes her life almost with a sense of distance at times, focusing on events not feelings or emotions. There were a few passages of the book that felt more personal, and I enjoyed them. The part where she says she skipped the final ball of the inauguration night (the one she was most looking forward to) because she was simply too exhausted to go. There is a part where she writes about Sasha thinking that nobody came to see Barack Obama’s acceptance speech the night of the first election because the streets were empty, and that in that moment she realized that they were empty because now they were traveling with the President Elect. She describes how it felt to see for the first time the heavy security surrounding her husband when he became president with the massive helicopters, motorcade, snipers, secret agents, etc. That gave me goosebumps. I enjoyed reading about that tender moment when Malia got an ear infection on vacation in Hawaii and when Barack Obama had to choose between leaving her and Michelle alone to travel back home to cast an important vote in the Senate or staying with his family (which did need him). I was disappointed that she didn’t write about how life has been after leaving the White House. Yes, there is that one toast she made, but other than that, it’s mostly undisclosed in the book. Do they miss it? Do they get to enjoy their lives now more? What’s next for them (other than creating a foundation in Chicago)? The book doesn’t talk about that. In summary, I do recommend the book. Michelle Obama is a good writer, and she is likable. She writes about race, family life, being a working mother, friendships, and politics. It’s still an interesting read, if not a little bit too safe.”",1
"“Ordered this product directly from Technology LK before realizing that the same company also sells it through Amazon for a lower price. This backer rod is virtually identical to Frost King 'Poly Foam Caulk Saver' sold by Lowe's and other chains, except this is called Backer Rod and is 3/4' in diameter (actually, it's a bit less than 3/4'). 100' of this stuff weighs about as much as a box of feathers. The quality is typical of similar products (e.g., the Frost King), and it works fine for its intended purpose. My only complaint is that it came loosely rolled in a cardboard box instead of the obviously more convenient spool shown in the Amazon photo. Technology LK's website has the same Amazon photo for this product. See Customer Images. Two stars off for the deceptive photo.”",0
"The 1925 COBRA was among Valentino's last films--and it tends to divide the star's fans, who either rejoice at his appearance in a realistic drama or yearn for something that rivals his earlier, often outrageous seductive melodramas. The story concerns Count Rodrigo Torriani (Valentino), an impoverished Italian nobleman with a penchant for torrid affairs that lead to endless and often monetary difficulties. Largely in order to escape such difficulties, Rodrigo agrees to work for American antiques dealer Jack Dorning (Casson Ferguson)--only to find himself little better off in New York, where he wavers between office secretary Mary Drake (Gertrude Olmstead) and Jack's femme fatale wife Elise (Nita Naldi.) In a stylistic sense, COBRA shows what Valentino could do as an actor when he was not encumbered by the usual 'great seducer' scripts pressed upon him--and he acquits himself very well. The supporting cast, most particularly Naldi, is also excellent. But there is no two ways about it: COBRA is so low-key that it feels excessively slow as it moves toward its none-too-surprising conclusion. The film itself is beautiful to the eye. Valentino is very close to the height of his physical appeal and Naldi is stunningly beautiful in a series of Adrian-designed gowns; the art direction by William Cameron Menzies is excellent, and the cinematography by Fischbeck and Jennings has a velvety quality that is quite fine. Even so, and with a running time of just over an hour, COBRA feels excessively languid in tone. The DVD offers a handsome transfer and good music score, but little else. Recommended--but primarily for hardcore Valentino fans.",1
"Duofold makes an exceptional double layered thermal undershirt with a crew cut neck for incredibly cold weather. I got this not too long ago; and this particular undershirt is probably the best one I have when I want to use it as a layer of clothing to protect myself from the cold. I am also extremely impressed that it was designed to help protect U.S. Special Forces--now you KNOW it's going to help you stay warm in cold weather! This can be worn as underwear under your outdoor clothes or you can wear it in bed with thermal pajamas on over it. It does have odor resistant properties. Moreover, the fabric doesn't bunch up very much so it remains pretty comfortable while you're wearing it. This will last years with the proper care. I put mine in the regular clothes washer and dryer and it comes out fine. Note that this only comes in black; if you're concerned about the black color 'bleeding' onto other articles of clothing, wash this with garments that are not white. In addition, it shrinks very little. If you want to order this here, check the pricing and availability chart and the merchant sizing chart before you order. Overall, Duofold makes an awesome 'expedition weight two-layer thermal tagless crew' neck styled undershirt. I highly recommend it for when the temperature drops and you need to stay warm!",0
"I wanted to like this sleek router and I paid extra for the N capability as I wanted to improve my connection strength and speed. Unfortunately, this works no better than my G router; in fact, it keeps disconnecting me from the internet for no reason at all, and even when it works, the signal strength keeps fluctuating and the 'Connected' box keeps popping up every few minutes, making it extremely annoying. In fact, the signal strength is actually poorer in some spots where it used to be good. It also does not support VPN connections and results in a lot of dropouts. I also use a Vonage VOIP phone over my cable internet connection which is connected to this router. I was expecting some voice quality improvement too after installing this router, but there is no improvement at all. In fact, since the connection keeps getting dropped, people keep thinking I'm hanging up on them, which is not good at all! However, on the pro side, the setup of this router was super-easy and took no effort on my part. All I did was pop in the CD and then followed the simple directions and 10 minutes later the router was installed. I find the design very sleek, but the blue icons on the front panel are very brightly lit and very distracting at night unless covered with something. Overall, I am quite disappointed with the performance of this router and I'm going to send it back and go back to my older G-router.",1
"I love my cats. I'd love them even more, however, if they didn't shed. But, since that's not a possibility, this is the next best solution. The rubber tips on the vac are fantastic for picking up cat hair (and I imagine dog hair as well) from furniture, carpeted stairs, or any other fabric. Unlike the powered heads, this does not have a spinning roller bar. You'd think that would be a disadvantage, but it is not - in fact, it works much better than a powered head. The rubber flexes to get into all the places where hair hides. More importantly, there is no risk of damage to fabrics. Power heads can snag on threads, and can really damage throws and blankets (especially anything made of yarn). The Bissell, however, just gets the hair out! It's bagless so no cost for replacement bags. Easy to empty, but the collection chamber is small - you have to empty it fairly often. Bissell also makes just the rubber attachment that you can use on their vacs or, with an adapter, pretty much any upright or canister vac. I have one of those as well (use it with the Bissell Healthy Home upright, which is another good product), but this vac is great when you don't want to break out the big vacuum for a small job. Also perfect for stairs since you don't have to lug a big vac, or pull a long hose. One of these should come with every cat adoption at the Humane Society! Top notch product.",0
"It is very rare that we can get to pick all three - as in this case. I purchased this item (Transcend M5 Multi Card Reader) because I need to read/write high-capacity SDHC cards, and my old card reader (Lexar Media RW022-001) is unable to recognize them. So far, I have tested the Transcend M5 with many different brands of CF and SD/SDHC cards, and it worked flawlessly. Just for fun, I also benchmarked several CF and SD cards in both my new Transcend M5 and old Lexar reader. I'm surprised to find out that the card reader actually makes a big difference in the data transfer rate.",0
"For example: when I benchmarked the SanDisk 2GB Ultra II CF Card in my old Lexar reader, I received a rather disappointing write speed of 4.1MB/S (equivalent to '27x'). But the same card in the new Transcend M5 gave me a write speed of 5.9MB/S (equivalent to '40x'). That's nearly 50% faster data transfer rate! Other CF and SD cards tested also showed similar performance boosts. (Note that Sandisk claims the Ultra II CF is capable of 15MB/S, but that's the maximum speed under optimal test condition.) In summary, the Transcend M5 card reader is very inexpensive, gives a much faster data rate than my old card reader, and seems to be very well-constructed. That makes it an excellent buy in my book.",0
"This package includes four rechargeable NiMH batteries (2x AA + 2x AAA) plus a simple charger. The batteries are the new Rayovac 'Hybrid', which are advertised to have a very low self-discharge rate similar to the better-known Sanyo Eneloop. The capacity of the Hybrid AA cell is rated at 2100mAh, slightly higher than that for the Eneloop (2000mAh). I have tested both brands and can confirm that their ratings are accurate. The Hybrid AAA cells, however, were tested to be slightly lower than the rated 800mAh capacity. In my 5-month self-discharge test, Sanyo Eneloop retained about 85% capacity, while Hybrid kept about 80%. For all practical applications, the two brands are equally good. So the Rayovac Hybrid could be a better value - if you can find it at a lower price than Eneloop. The charger included in this package, however, is a piece of junk. It is a timer-based dumb charger that simply charges for 8 hours at around 350mA and then turns off (obviously it was designed to charge 2500-2700mAh cells, because 350*8=2800). It also forces you to charge cells in pairs. Both 'features' are bad for your batteries. The charger included in the Sanyo Eneloop package is 'smart', in the sense that it charges each cell independently, and stops when each cell is full. If you are looking for a travel charger that is smart, compact, and reasonably fast, I highly recommend the KODAK K6200.",0
"These headphones are pretty damn good for the money! It's just as good--if not better--than most of the competitors producing in-ear headphones that cost more than 5-10x as much. There's no reason to spend £100-100+ on some in-ear headphones when you can simply pick these up at less than a fraction of the cost. I would highly recommend these to anyone considering them. The clarity is consistent and the bass is AMPLE. Your music will sound full and dynamic, making a pleasurable experience for any sound played through them. Not to mention, the quality is durable and they will last for months. I'd give this a 6-star rating if possible.",0
"These are amazing for £10. AMAZING. They stick in your ear regardless of the exercise I've been doing. Jolting around, weights, running, walking... they stick well enough to pull the little mp3 player I use (sansa clip+ excellent btw) out of my pocket. For £10, these cannot be beat.",0
"They fit very comfortably in my ear and have plenty of bass for my liking. They sound well balanced without too much emphasis on lows or highs. Maybe there's an expensive set out there which sounds amazing for true audiophiles, but I would recommend these to anyone looking for quality without breaking the bank. They feel like they might even stay in place while working out without having to use around-the-ear clips.",0
"These earbuds will change the way you look at this brand. I've always thought most of the stuff this brand made was kind of cheap, and looking at these earbuds and their price, it was hard not to think the same about them as well. But, even being a really big skeptic of them, even after reading review after review on these earbuds of how amazing they were, I ordered a pair to make my own decision about how good they actually were. After getting them, I quickly followed the advice of one of the reviews I had read and found the right size ear pads that go over the earbuds to make sure I had the best fit possible with them. After listening to them for a week straight--7-8 hours a day and with different kinds of music: rock, r&b, trance, etc.--to make sure they were getting a full-rounded break-in period, they became music to my ears! The lows, mids, and highs were exactly what I was looking for so long in some earbuds! I couldn't believe my ears! These earbuds really did deliver! I've tried Audio Technica's earbuds with some people claiming they sounded as good as the ATH-M50x's (which is a pretty big claim), only to find out that the reviewer was wrong; they weren't even close to how good the ATH-M50x's sounded. They lacked bass and the highs were ear-piercing! With this brand's it was all there and well-balanced, and they get better and better the more I use them. If you're looking for a good pair of earbuds, don't pass these up. You can't beat what you get for what a small price you pay for these earbuds.",0

A must for secure travel. Exactly what it says, nice belt with no metal and a zipper on the inside. Holds and hides money or small pieces of papers very well. Good for traveling outside of the country.",0
"This light might look crazy but it's a BEAST when it comes to output. So this headlamp is bright. I plan on getting lots of use out of this headlamp. Included is the headlamp, USB charging cable, wall charging adapter, and the headlamp itself (with rechargeable battery). There are four modes of operations. First is the center light, second is the outer lights, third is all lights, and the fourth is a strobe light mode with all lights turned on. The strap is adjustable and very comfortable. I was concerned about the weight of the large light on the front and the battery pack on the back. However, it is very evenly weighted so it ended up not being too heavy at all. The light is very bright and you can change the zoom of the center light to be highly focused or widely spread out. The outer lights can change focus just very slightly. This is my overall opinion: Pros: 5 Bright lights, Fast charge, Long lasting up to 3-7 hours under full charge, Shines really far, Hands free, Convenient, Great rotation, For so many different uses, Rechargeable batteries, Different levels of brightness, Has strobe, Zoom in and out, Fits nice, Sturdy and seems durable, Lightweight. Cons: None that I can find. Overall 5 of 5 stars, would definitely recommend.",0
"This knee pillow is very comfortable. I like it much better than trying to use a regular pillow. The regular pillow doesn't stay in place and is not as comfortable. This has helped me with back pain. The pillow fabric covering is very soft. The elastic band keeps the pillow in place. I will recommend this to my friends.",0
"When I ordered the Solar Path Lights for outdoor use I had no idea how beautiful they would be. They arrived in record time, no damage to the exterior or interior boxes. The lights already had been charged with solar energy. All I had to do was assemble them, which was extremely easy. First, I twisted the back of the light, the back came off, I switched the switch to on, reconnected the back to the light, put 2 rods together, connected the light to the rod (holder), and placed the solar-powered lights into the ground. As soon as evening set in, the solar-powered lights came on! The lights fade from one color to another, going from dim to a very pretty crystal-like brighter shine, adding a sweet glow to the garden. My pictures do not show the actual beauty or reflection of these sweet Solar Path Outdoor Lights! A must have!",0
"This product is brilliant. The way it writes is so smooth that I can honestly say I cannot live without it. It also keeps children occupied for hours at a time without wasting ink or crayons. I tend to need to write everything down and got tired of seeing post-its everywhere. There is an easy delete button so when it gets full or you want to change the thing you just wrote, it's as easy as hitting that button and the screen goes blank. It comes with a convenient carry soft case for protection while traveling or storing and it's the perfect size for the kid. This tablet had a choice of many colors! It also came with a pen and sleeve to carry it in. The pen attaches to the bottom on the tablet so it will not be misplaced. We also received a magnet to place on the back of the tablet, just in case I wanted to hang it on the fridge or something metallic. I love that the entire screen's worth of writing can be erased instantly with the single press of a button. For usage scenarios like my grocery list, it eliminates the hassle of throwing out the previous list and starting over or having to erase things on a whiteboard. It's a very handy feature and a definite time saver. The device operates on batteries in order to use the delete button, it's made from good quality eco-friendly material and looks very posh when someone asks for some paper to write something on temporarily, the writing pen works very well with the pad. The parcel arrived the next day (via Prime) and the packaging was incredibly secure - no chance of damage in transit. Great value for money, especially for a supplier. I highly recommend both the product and the company.",1
"This mirror came securely packaged in the plastic air-filled wrapping to give it maximum protection during transit. The mirror arrived as expected. First of all, I would like to say that this mirror is purchased for my wife, for whom I'm writing this review. This mirror is perfect. I have been wanting one of these for so long and I'm glad to now have one. It has folding doors, one on each side. You will see on the left side you are able to magnify X2 and 3x for things like plucking eyebrows or specific eyeshadow designs. Also comes with a small 10x magnifying mirror which can stick anywhere using suction pods. On the front is the on/off switch and then once you open the two doors you will see a simple touch button to turn the light on. My room doesn't get a ton of light so this mirror has been such a useful tool. You can see as displayed in the pictures you can turn the mirror upward as you need to. Sometimes I stand to do some things makeup wise so this is really a cool option to me. You will receive a USB style cable which you can use to plug in your Android phone charger. That's what I do but it also has an option for batteries. I think that is a pro because it makes the mirror so much more portable if you don't want to bring any extra cables or if the power happens to go out. The light is very ambient but bright enough to see exactly what you're doing. You get so much more clarity than trying to do this in the bathroom mirror. I highly recommend this mirror. It's fairly lightweight, portable, you have several different options for magnification. Awesome mirror in my book! Overall, I highly recommend everyone get this mirror if you want to stop looking for the right lighting just so you can do your makeup. The LED lights provide the perfect lighting everywhere and the magnified mirrors really come in handy. Such good quality at an amazing price. The mirror is about the size of my iPad Air 2 before you open the little doors so it's just the right size.",1
"This is an amazing diffuser and I have really enjoyed using it. I have several others but this one is larger and can run longer. The wood grain finish is especially pretty and matches well in the bedroom where I use it. It's nice at night to wake up and have subtle light in the room. Just plug it in, add water and a few drops of your favorite essential oil and your home will smell great. Add more oil for a dinner scent or less for something more subtle. Very easy to use and clean. Just press the button on the front side to set the timer and walk away. The diffuser emits a fine steam that smells amazing. I also like the ability to change the light to different colors or have it change on its own. Exactly as described by the manufacturer. A user-friendly device that is very simple to set up, clean, refill, and operate. One button turns on/off the light, which changes colors and adds ambiance to any room. The vapor function works on a timed cycle that is operated by the push of one button. The aroma begins immediately and provides a very pleasant scent to our large living room-kitchen-dining-office area. It also holds a lot of water and therefore doesn't have to be refilled after one use on the max number of hours. Can't find any fault with this unit. I would definitely recommend this. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this.",0
"The cable seems very well constructed. The connectors are nice and solid and provide a good fit. The line itself is a very nice quality braiding. I purchased a Samsung 4K TV a while ago but had much older HDMI cables I was using and wow what a difference the new HDMI cables have made with the picture. These cables are reasonably priced and have great quality workmanship. They are made really good with braided cords to help protect the wires on the inside. The tips are gold and help to have a better quality picture of your HD TV. I would recommend these.",0
"This is a heavy-duty case but it isn't a heavy case. I have a daughter who has reached the age that she's all arms and elbows and awkward clumsy moments. This means that the iPad has been dropped and bumped and jarred around. In fact, one iPad has been dropped and fixed so many times it finally just had to be replaced. So we thought we'd try this case instead. This case was easy to install on the iPad. Additionally, once it is on, it stays on. This means the iPad isn't slipping out of the case to fall on the floor, nor is it slipping around in the case. It fits well. The holes in the case align perfectly and we have had no problem using headphones or charging the iPad with the case on. One of the bonus parts of this case is the built-in screen protector. That was a plus for us since it meant only one item to protect it all. The screen did not have the rainbow view I've read about so that is nice. Great product. Would recommend it.",0
"The camera came in Amazon's standard cardboard packaging to avoid any damage during shipment, it comes in an attractive box and would make an ideal gift. This WiMiUS action camera came in almost all the necessary accessories you will ever need on an action camera. A backup battery comes with the package allowing more filming and more beautiful pictures. There are, in fact, more reasons that I decided to purchase this action camera. First of all, the image surely has high definition and video is able to offer 4K quality, which allows me to catch all the great moments when I am recording, the video has pretty good continuity. Secondly, the action camera can be controlled using wifi, which is an awesome function, and taking a selfie of a group of people at a distance becomes possible. No need to carry a selfie stick all the time. Also, I can mount the action camera somewhere and use the controller to take a video or photo of myself in motion. Most importantly, the price is attractive. Unlike some high-brand product, this action camera can be purchased at a pretty reasonable price, yet, without losing camera performance or image quality. If the budget is not allowed for some high-end product, this action camera is just the right one, even for real X-sports. The 4k video quality and 1080p picture quality, in my opinion, is amazing for such a price. This is just the perfect camera for sports as videos don’t get blurry when there is too much movement or shaking, the picture is clear and crisp. Wide-angle option up to 170 degrees, I like this feature because it's really useful when trying to capture a beautiful landscape. It has an awesome feature of hooking it up through wifi to your device that is very cool and convenient to share content fast and on the go. Lightweight and a pretty small size even comparing to similar analogs. The camera has an extensive menu of features that is extremely easy to navigate to get the exact picture or video that you need for what you are trying to achieve. The menu is very intuitive for all the major important options. If you don't have a need for all the other settings then they will not get in your way, because in terms of user-friendliness it is very easy to use. Comes with an abundance of accessories and the accessories are of good quality. It is a very versatile action camera. I think the waterproof casing is awesome. I highly recommend this camera. It is great to bring to places where you won't bring a regular camera or a phone. I am very happy with the purchase of this item. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this.",1
"This was delivered securely in Amazon's standard packaging to avoid any damage and arrived on time as expected. To start off I have put the review into categories. How it Feels: Perfect fit for any size hand really. It has an ergonomic feel to it, and I never feel like my hand needs to do any extra stretching or compressing to cooperate with mouse usage. Very nice grip pad feel to it, builds your confidence to know it won't slip out of your hand, and just generally a nice feeling to have. How it Looks: It looks like any expensive gaming mouse. It has a streak of light down each side of the mouse towards the bottom where your palm would lay (mostly for looks, and doesn't affect usage of mouse whatsoever), it's even been extruded inwards to avoid having to feel the streaks while using the mouse. How Well Does it Function: This does not need to be a mouse for gaming. I think it'd be useful for daily users as well while adding some neat looks rather than a boring old mouse. Could also be a great conversation starter. Anyways, have not had any problems with it since I've got this. Works like any mouse would, it uses an optical mode. No lags, no disconnects, no stalling. Buttons have a nice feel and sound to it when you click them, all of them. Features: It has the usual left and right button, but it also has an anti-skid scroll wheel which is awesome. It has indents so you could have that nice feel to it when scrolling, and never accidentally scroll too far because you slip. Has two programmable side buttons as mentioned in the specs of the product. It's very useful even just to browse the internet, you can click the side buttons to either go forward a page or backward to the previous page. I've not thought much about it before buying, but have been using it almost religiously since. A plus: The wire is 1.7 meters in length. Overall: It is worth the money. Whether you're a gamer or a normal average computer user, this mouse would be perfect. Keep in mind, this is a perfect mouse for gaming if you're just the average gamer. Obviously, if you're full-on a game enthusiast to the max, you probably wouldn't even be looking at this mouse. Recommend this product.",0
"This is a very sturdy and convenient car mount, and definitely one of my favorites by far. It installs very easily, and the mount makes the phone firm and stable but easily positionable in any direction. The phone rotates 360 degrees and angles in almost any direction. The magnet feels strong, even though a case--too strong to come off the mount by accident but easy to unmount with a firm pull. This magnetic mount is much better than some of the vent car mounts I've tried because the phone can easily overheat when you are using heat in the car if it's right in front of the vent. It also doesn't require any fidgeting when you are mounting and unmounting the phone - you just stick it on the mount and go. I was a little hesitant to stick the adhesive metal circle onto the back of the phone, but it lies completely flat under the case so that I don't even know it's there. And for those few times when I have the case off, the design of the plate is nice and doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone. No more having my phone fall off when I'm driving because it's sitting on the dash - I can easily see and access the screen while I'm driving. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this.",1
"These lights are great, you can do so many different things with them! I really like the copper wire versus the white or green coated plastic wire you get with a typical string of lights. They seem so simple when you look at them right out of the package. But they add a fantastic look to any décor idea. The copper wire makes it very discreet and the LEDs are small so you really don't notice that they are around the branches of the trees until you light them up and they just look beautiful. The warm white color looks cozy because it is NOT that artificial super bright white. and yes, they are LED, so the energy consumption of the whole series is like one small bulb. With 5 modes ON /Flash/Timer / Timer Flash / OFF, the timer set can be 6 hours on and 18 hours off on each day which will last for more than half a month, these are powered by 6 AA batteries, rechargeable ones would be ideal, overall I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend. I hope you have found my review helpful. I would be grateful if you could tick the YES box to say that this review was helpful, many thanks for taking the time to read this.",0

"This review is written by my wife. This dress is absolutely beautiful. I couldn't have been happier when I first tried it on. The fit and style are exactly like the picture, which is a big relief. I also love the material. It is nice and thick and not cheap. This dress has easily become my favorite and my default for any summer day that I want to dress a bit nicer. The great thing about this dress is that you can wear it anywhere since it is so casual. I love that. I cannot say enough about this dress. For the price, this is by far a super deal and I expect the dress to last years.",0
"These are very pretty and I enjoy looking at them. They are perfect for the use I wanted them for. The flowers are nice and large. The colors are soft and pretty. There is enough foliage with them to fill out the bouquet. Nice. Very pleased.",0
"Exactly as described and does exactly what it is supposed to do.",0
"It works great and is a life saver if you use a flask a lot. I travel a good bit now and take a flask with me. Having this makes it 100% easier to fill the flask than bending a plastic cup. It's well made and will not retain odors or flavors after a simple water rinse.",0
"This Kit came securely packaged to avoid any damage. I'm really impressed with this, it's easy to figure out and to set it up for use. These are great lenses I ever had for my phone. They work great and are easy to assemble, adjust and focus. It was really fun and cool. Great quality and durable. Easy to carry around anywhere. It enhances the power and usability of my iPhone during a nature trip. Now, I can take sharper and brighter pictures of objects that are in the far distance. They come with a small carrying bag to keep them from getting lost. I never thought I'd be able to get this much zoom with my phone, this paired with the phone's built-in zoom gets spectacular pictures. I tested it in my house on a flower and it turned out very clear. I can literally think of 100 things I want to take pictures of with my phone that I couldn't simply because it was too far or too small, but now with this zoom, I don't have to compromise image quality to get a zoomed-in image! Overall opinion: Great photography accessory, really makes a difference to your camera. Makes a standard camera look professional, definitely worth the buy, the lens itself is great quality and comes in a well-protected box so no damages to your package, also fits on phone well and is light and secure. Great product.",1
"It's great! Holds all that I need in a light, functional way. Pleasantly surprised at how much it can hold and how easily I can access what I need. Also added security has RFID to protect your cards.",1
"It really works and works wonders. USES: * You can put anything on top of it for baking and nothing will stick. The first instinct is to bake cookies on them and you will be surprised how EVEN they will bake. * I then tried frozen fish with dry rub condiments and it came out perfect. The skins don't stick and everything just slides off the mat. No oil added whatsoever. * I frequently make croissants and notice that the bottom won't burn as fast as when done on a plain baking sheet. * I also use the mat to handle sticky items like sugar for candy-making and dough. You won't need any flour to spread on the counter as this does the job just fine. You will wonder how you were able to bake without it for the longest time. CLEANING: * The best part is the cleanup. You soak it in water and simply wipe off the food particles on the mat. * For a thorough cleaning, just use mild soap and a soft sponge. * Stick it from the freezer to the oven and back to the freezer and it is perfectly OK. Nothing will crack or burst from the changing temperature - unlike glass pans. * It is very flexible. Bend it, roll it, spread it out and use it for your rolling pin for the top and bottom. * That being said, enjoy the product and the wonder that it does. But use it with care. If used properly, it is worth every money spent.",1
"Smells great and really works to freshen a car! The smell lasted in my car for about a week but the main point was it got the bad smoke odor out of my A/C system.",1
"“This scale is very well made, accurate, and strong! It also looks pretty sleek on my kitchen counter.What I like about this scale is that I can wipe it down with a damp sponge, and the scale is able to handle the dampness.It can be powered by batteries or USB which comes with the scale. In all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SCALE.",1
"This is a really nice set of measuring cups and spoons. My wife recently started seriously baking and wanted an upgrade from all the hodgepodge plastic measuring cups and spoons, and a silicone set, that she had been using. Very pleased with these. They are well made and sturdy and seem to be pretty accurate. She has not done any precise measurements but they are at least as reliable as the ones she replaced. i.e. No appreciable differences in volume measurements between the various sets.These are well made. I like things to be as indestructible as possible, with a long, useful life. These will last. These are nice quality, and with reasonable care, should last forever.The measurements are stamped into the spoons and cups. That was a requirement for her. She also really likes the little pouring lip on the cups.After shopping around pretty extensively and comparing prices and quality, these were a really good buy.Very happy with these.I would definitely recommend these",1
"These headphones come Nice packaged in a sturdy white box and are ideal as a gift.The box details the features of this product.Inside the box, you will find the headphones with a 3.5mm audio cable and instructions.The aesthetics of the headphones brilliant. The padding on the earphones and headband feels extremely comfortable, allowing for continuous usage.The headphones also fold down allowing for easier storage.In the brief test I did, it seemed to cope well with this feature.I tested this with my usual mix of songs I use for testing any headphones or speakers; Fools Gold by Stone Roses, Superstar by Lupe Fiasco and Killed by death by Motorhead.The sound quality is extremely impressive for the price of the headphones. The treble and mid-range of the headphones are extremely clear. The bass is strong and well defined. These headphones also have a superb noise canceling feature.They are extremely good value for money and I would recommend them.Thank you for taking the time to read my review",1
"Looks great, fits the car perfectly and the price was RIGHT!! My daughter loves how they look in her car. Really can't beat that!!",1
"This wallet arrived the next day using prime membership. Very pleased with this wallet, it is made of soft leather it is strong and has space for all the essentials e.g. cards, driving license, cash and more besides and fits into pockets without drawing attention to the owner have a space for coins. ( not bulky looking) great orange look colour At the same time you can see that the wallet is well made and will give a long life to the owner, I would recommend this wallet.”",1
"Good quality card, which is A4 in size when folded",1
"Good price, great quality, work as they should, highly recommended",1
"This thing is very easy to use. It is light, and the wheel turning acts like a gyroscope, steadying it. It cuts, grinds, sands and anything else you could think of without bogging down. It was also very cheap. It is high quality and I expect it to last a long time",1
"Perfect fit, no problems at all, stopped the leak instantly	",1
"This worked perfectly to mix powder and water (that doesn't mix with spoon. The lid seems very safe - non-spill.",1

"I bought these to actually put over the drains in my tub to help prevent a lot of hair going down the drain as we are always having problems with the drains clogging. Our drain caps don?t come off so I couldn?t figure out how to get anything down there to try and clean them out. Luckily, this set came with these 2 orange snake like plastic pieces. Turns out that they worked amazingly. I was able to get them down into the drain and clean out the hair. Would recommend",0
"This is my first bluetooth earphones purchase, and so far I'm very pleased.Pairing with a device was a snap, and the sound is great for a non audiophile -- there's more bass than any plug-in headphones I own, and the earbuds -- even without using any of the included attachments -- are truly noise canceling. Standing at my desk, I'm completely immersed in writing this review and cannot hear what my family is yammering at me.Lastly, charge time is fast, and the battery life is good, though I haven't measured either other than empirically. And I've only recharged the unit a few times",1
"Amazing for the price!! Don't need to worry about losing expensive earbuds.However,their sound is great and mic is good to hear other person's speaking on phone.they stay in my ears stablely and I never fell uncomfortable.I run and walking wearing them! Happy with this purchase !",0
"I bought it for myself for music, honestly speaking, these are fantastic earphones, especially for the price. The extra tips help me find the correct size that suits me well then they will not fall out from my ears and also do no harm to my ears. Sound quality is very good also, which is of course the most important for headphones",0
"Similar to other reviews, the placement of the earbud fitting is a bit odd, since its not centered..but for me, it fits well, and the sound is very nice. Good bass, and nice trebs. I've gotten headphones that were horrible, and I'm not the type to spend megabucks for a set of headphones...Most I spent at the local Fry's store is around £20 or so, but these are among the clearest sounding ones I've had, and they fit well with my ear holes...for a lot cheaper",0
"These are the first in-ear headphones I have found that fit my small ear opening. They have 3 sizes of inserts and I needed the smallest ones. They are comfortable and stay in my ear when performing everyday activities and exercising. So happy to have found these and the sound quality is exceptional! Get these--you won't be disappointed",0
"Although I purchased these headphones based on all of the good reviews I was still very leary because they are such a good price. Well, I received them yesterday and could not wait to try them out and must say I was very impressed! The sound quality is exceptional and the fit is very comfortable! I will definitely recommend purchasing these headphones!",1
"Under £10 and sound this great? Buying this should be a no brainer! One tip - I noticed far better sound when I inserted the headphones slightly into my ear versus pushing these all the way in. The latter results in muted sound and lost clarity. I still can't believe these are just £10! I have spent far too much money on other brands like MEE Electronics, JBL, etc and have been sorely disappointed. Not with these ones!What are you waiting for ... Order it already",0
"its so small to what I imagined. Loud for its size. It is light and fits in a hoodie pocket. satisfied it",1
"Love it. Exactly what I wanted",0
"The very best speaker available, all others can't compare to this speaker! So good I'm going to order another one, so I cank link them for even more great sound",0
"These earphones are incredible. I received mine today and they work beautifully. The volume can be amplified much more than any I have ever owned. I bought the black ones. They can be very loud and they fit snug in your ears. They also come with two other pairs of those ear bud things so you can exchange it for your proper size. And they also arrived earlier than they were supposed to. Great pair. You should buy it especially for the price.",0
"These headphones are very comfortable. I think for the money they sounds great and the battery life has been great as well. I would buy them again for sure and see no need to spend more money on headphones than these",0
"I bought these to fly with as I was looking for earbuds that had decent sound with noise cancelling.I am extremely happy with this purchase.Highly recommend these",0
"Truth be told i originally bought these for my wife becasue well..... She is very hard on earbuds! I did my usual research online and found the earbuds were getting some ok to decent reviews, now that being said these are going for £10.79 on amazon as i type this. I am a Sennheiser man to the core..... that being said i gave her my 30 pound sennheiser earbuds and took these from her!!! Very HappyPros: Of Course the Price who can Say no to £10, Audio Quality is amazing i find it on-par with my £100 pound set of Sennheiser Earbuds! Also they do come with different size buds for those of us with large or small ear canalsOnly slight Con: The this brand In-Ear Headphone is not the standard straight earbud they have a slight offset to them and that is why my wife didnt like them, I personally have no issues with it.",0
"When it comes to 'bang for the buck these headphones are definitely high on the list. They sound MUCH better than some terrible Sony on-ear headphones I had purchased a few weeks ago. If you are in the market for some cheap, quality headphones, these are the ones you want. I was not used to in-ear bud earphones and for the first week or so, they weren't too comfortable, but after changing the rubber pieces to the smallest size, they now feel great",0
"Accomplishes purpose for purchasing and greatly exceeds expectations.Great sounding, durable, well attached to the ear, and keeps on working strong. I bought these headphones, looking for something for a workout and they are great. No soft parts to get wet or worn, and the sound is very good (for the price) and excellent volume and sound quality for the price. Stay on my ear well whether I'm running or lying down on a weight bench",0
"I got a set of these as a 'freebie when I bought a Sansa Clip. The Sansa has since died and I am still using these earbuds. I have owned many different earbuds, including high-end Bose and others that were not as good as these are. They are extremely comfortable and don't fall out of my ears. They sound just as good as the higher-end earbuds I have used. If these ever die, which they don't seem capable of, I will buy them again",0
"Have had pairs of bluetooth headphones and wired headphones,most of them is not well-made,so I'm looking for some quality one instead of the old headphones.Find this one is quiet a balance from sound quality and wearing comfort,beside wired headphones can deliver better sound quality than the bluetooth one.So if you don't mind the price,this will be a good choice",0
"There is no reason I shouldn't throw this into the 5 star rating. Price alone makes this worth buying. Are you getting Beats by Dr. Dre?.. no you are getting a solid unit.I bought these after I lost my travel set.First the negatives:The cord quality isn't amazing. I could see this unit fray and start to short out (as so many of my buds have done). Though I have to admit I wind these around my hand and throw them into my laptop case and the cables aren't looking too bad.The sound is OK... quiet compared to others I have tried (but notice others were more expensive than this).The good:My problems with my last headset is that the ear buds kept falling out. This unit will not have that problem, in fact getting the rubber off and on is kind of a pain... but a much better pain then losing them.The price is unbeatable for what you get.I find this comfortable (again compared to similar models).You looking for a headset that works, is worth the money then you want this unit",0
"I've had 5 of these and they are the best headphones for the price. Clear sound and an inline mic make it highly functional for those who love music and want to contact those on the go. Some reviewers said that one side of their earbud crapped out after a couple of weeks. This only happened to me when I accidentally put it in the washing machine. So don't be an idiot like me and damage your earphones. I put mine in a case storage so I don't damage them and even if I do I'm only set back a Hamilton",0
"These are probably the best headphones you can get for the money, period. its the biggest bang for your buck for sure. At roughly £10, these are way underpriced for the performance they can put on. They are very comfortable, are designed well, and sound fantastic.I was looking for 2 pairs of throwaway headphones - one to leave by my bed, and one to carry around. I tend to lose headphones often, so I wasn't looking to spend much. Based on the great reviews, I went for these. The reviews were spot on. I got much more than I could have expected from a cheap pair of headphones. I would recommend these to anyone!",0
"Great product. Very easy to set up and use and seems to be very accurate so far in counting steps and tracking sleep. Lightweight and comfortable to wear - I forget I have it on",0
"This little guy is amazing. Was blown away by how loud it was and the quality of the sound it puts out. I was using an older Jam for work and beach vacations, but I'm stoked that I'll be bringing this guy on my next trip. We'll see how it holds up in that environment. I had this at work with me yesterday and its loud and clear. Bass is pretty good also for what it is.....just remember its not a sub. For the cost, you can't co wrong",0
"Headphones work great, good sound, easy to pair, and come with a bunch of tips so you can choose what works best. Seller (7desk) checked in after receiving product. I had a small problem with the foam tips and mentioned this in reply to sellers email. Even though I wasn't expecting them to do anything about it, they were able to provide a fix to the issue quickly. Product and customer service exceeded expectations. I wish every seller on Amazon was like 7desk",1
"I used to go through a pair of earbuds about every 2 to 3 weeks. They always end up getting crushed by books, my laptop, or me stepping on them; but not these. These are easily the most durable earbuds I have ever owned. I'm going on 3 months with these things, and i'm still so pleasantly surprised with this product. If you have the same problem I did, get these and you will not regret it",0
"This speaker is amazing. Its larger size than I expected. Clear sound with bass. The battery life is amazing. I can select the color style I like, about 7 color styles. Of course I can turn off the LED lights. Absolutely worth $59.99",0
"This small product works just like a bigger one. It looks and sounds great. Great for teens and can be carried wherever they go. Make a great gift or stocking stuffer. Would recommend it to others",0
"Oh my, you wouldn't believe this! I have been using this earbug for over a month already and it still works great! No damages, no error, no sound different...nothing! Just great as it was new! I love this. I already recommended this to my sister and she likes it too. Great price for a great quality product!I always wanted a great sound earbuds for long, but they are all too expensive and I don't think it worth that much.So when I see this one with over 10 thousands reviews saying this is awesome...I have to try it!And yes, I LOVE IT! Like others!This product has a really great sound and a really cheap price! It also fits into my ears SO WELL!!! That's the most amazing part about this, it really won't fell out like other earbuds.But on'y one downside is that the string is easy to mash together and you need 2 minutes to fix it.. Well, I am thinking to buy a case for it so it won't be like that too bad.Also, if I lost it, I will still get this one again NO DOUBT. Great sound, great in-ear design, and great price! Where can you find it?Afterall, this is the first earbuds that I think is worth the price and really great condition!!! You gotta believe all the good reviews I guess",0
"I have to say these earbuds are the best I've had yet! And the prices was unbeatable! I run and these things stay snugly in my ears and are comfortable as well! The sound is a bit low but I got use to it and it does drown out most outside noise. Will absolutely buy again! Can't beat what you get for the price",0
"-The sound quality is good for the price -sturdy earphones and does not look as if it can be broken easily -It can reduce surrounding noise,even when played at high volumes it cannot be heard by those around you.,0I've had these earbuds for a few months now and I love them so much. For less than £15, these actually sound good enough for me to write a five-stars review. I watch a movie or listen to music in bed and fall asleep with these in my ears, they are not uncomfortable. Want to buy another set for my wife. Highly recommend!",0
"Read the reviews and decided to try these out. I didn't need them and have 4 other sets of cheapo earbuds. I've been blown away by these ones.The sound quality seems to be good. I'm no audiophile and months of riding motorcycles/snowmobiles, playing in a band, etc have made me less picky about hearing the nuances of my music. That said, these seem to deliver stronger, thumpier (not like headshaking but a nice solid sound) bass than the Gummy earbuds and the iFrogz (cheapest set they make) I purchased a few months ago. The highs on the iFrogz seem to be about the same.The biggest thing I've noticed with these headphones is that the cord is way quieter than on any of the other cheap earbuds I've tried. I wore these snowmobiling and was blown away by the lack of staticy scrunching noises from brushing against my shirt/jacket liner. I personally like the 90* connector, it lets me route the cord around my kindle case then close the case so I can toss it in my backpack while riding and not have to worry as much about it getting smashed up and have tunes in the snow.I've recommended these particular earbuds to 2 friends now and will continue to do so until I find something better",0
"These in-ear earbuds truly are the best ones that exist on this planet, at this price range. No they are not the best ones that exist, but are absolutely incredible for the low price. They actually sound very good and are quite comfortable. Comfort is a huge factor with earbuds, not only sound quality. They will sound really awful if you do not have the right fit though. They come with 3 different size covers, so make sure you try all 3, in both ears, to find the best fit. If you do not get the right fit then you will not get the great sound that can be achieved with these. Yes, I said try all 3 different sizes in BOTH of your ears. Your left and right ear canal MAY actually be shaped differently. I was aware of this and I went back and forth with all three sizes to find the best fit, and best sound for me, when I first opened them. The largest size is what works best for me. These are quite amazing. If I was to point out the biggest downside of these earbuds I would have to say the isolation is a little lacking. If you don't know what that is then you probably don't really care. Bottom-line is that you should own at least one pair of these, even if you have really awesome expensive ones. These are cheap and sound amazing. Very satisfied with my purchase!",0
"Great sounding earbuds. Very comfortable to wear.The sound quality for ear buds is exceptional.They're a great producer for the price.Came As Listed",0
"Stays in snug, maintains good sound quality, and does so cheaply. The little fittings are unusual in that they are oblong, but this works really well for the product. As with any headphones that use the thicker rubber earpieces, they can cause a little irritation after a while if you're not used to wearing them.I bought three of these instead of shelling out the money to buy a pair of lesser-quality headphones with better marketing.",0
"Lots but simple to say:1.The package is tidy and nice, of course the shipping speed is fast, ordered it on Tuesday, received on the Wednesday!2.Come with two pairs of extra ear tips in different size, the small ones suits me well, feel comfortable in this size.3.Bass included! and sound is clear!4.Everything seems good of it except for the price, it is a bit expensive to me, but it is really a awesome headphones.",0
"These sound awesome, especially for the price. The sound is very clean, though the bass is a little weak. I bought a pair of the Amazon Basics In-Ear Headphones at the same time to compare. The Amazon Basics Headphones are good, but the sound is not nearly as clean as these. The bass in the Amazon Basics headphones is much better, but the sound is a bit grainy and distorted in my opinion. The headphones are comfortable, and the shape of the ear buds Nice indicate which ear they go in, with out having to look at the R/L letter, a nice touch if you're putting them on in the dark. The quality of the materials these are made with feels good, but the Amazon Basics feel a bit better. However, I purchased a pair of these two months ago which still work today. I bought these because one of my kids took my old pair to use. Finally, beware of the packaging, they are hard to get into and the extra ear cushions (Small/Large) will go flying. I would buy these again",0
"Some maniac wrote a very technical review for these, and how great they were.... I appreciate the opinion of that maniacal variety and so I bought em! its true.... I dont appreciate all the sound techie stuff I'm sure.....but they are way better than the ones Ive been using....and they fit great and stay in, which is a huge plus for me... It is also true that they are very insulating or whatever it is that makes it dangerous to use while running, since you can't hear outside noise at all! So I do use just one ear when I'm running in traffic lest I get ran over to Bon Jovi's greatest hits! Great price too! Yay",0
"Easy to link. Good volume and clear sound. Good battery life.",0
"I was skeptical as to if they would be as good as the bit more expensive black/white ones I had purchased. They are awesome. I am going to purchase a few more pairs of the green ones (because they are the cheapest) to have at work, and as a backup pair or just to use for something if I cant find my main pair. They block out sound pretty well and have good bass. MXditect is on point with their ear buds",0
"comfortable, light-weight and great sound",1
"These headphones are a fantastic value for the money. I am not an audio expert, but I do use these headphones every day, and they always deliver the same clear sound and good bass day in and day out. What is particularly good about these headphones is the design of the earpiece. I have tried several different kinds of in-ear headphones, and these are the ones that fit the best (I have small ears and this makes it difficult to find a pair that stays in my ear). Only one drawback to these headphones - they don't have a slider on the cord, but I just loop the extra one over my ear when I want to listen to only one headphone.",0
"I have had these for 3 months. They have withstood all sorts of abuse, and sound as good as the day I got them! Which is pretty good!- Good sound quality. Good bass.- They stay securely in my ears. They are also very comfortable. Other earbuds fall out and/or hurt, I can wear these for hours with ease.- They block just enough outside noise that you can listen to your music in peace, but they aren't absolutely noise canceling so you are able to have some awareness of your surroundings.- I have sweated all over these, even washed them, with no damage to them!These are by far the best earbuds I have ever used.",0
"Very happy with the item, it is as described and quiet a good quality. Sound output is also good for the price. Mic also works well with Bluetooth connectivity to phone, pairing was also super easy",1
"These are legit amazing.The price point is great. The durability is excellent. The comfort is unparalleled.I can't comment on the sound as compared to other earbuds because prior to buying these, I'd been unable to use earbuds for the previous two decades. Everything just _hurt_ my ear canals. I have left these in overnight, on long plane flights, and for hours of study / gaming time with absolutely no discomfort. I was even pleasantly surprised to find the medium sized buds fit my ears best, which means that somewhere, some people with even more trouble than I've had are probably throwing a party upon using the smallest size.The sound quality seems on par with the ultra-high quality, cushioned, noise-cancelling gaming headsets I've had with two exceptions:1. Bass doesn't have quite the same resonance.2. Directional sound is limited.That being said, for ten bucks, trying these was one of the best purchase decisions I've ever made.I've bought five or six pairs and everyone I've given them to has come straight back to buy them again as soon as they needed more. My SO's pair is finally beginning to fail (in terms of the connection, not the sound) after a months of daily use for 8+ hours. Last week he asked plaintively if I could find more exactly like them, which prompted a discussion of their virtues (and this review.)Try these--you won't go back.",0
"Small, lightweight, and compact. Not the most comfortable and not the best sounding, but they are cheap and do the job. Use these at work with periods of listening to music for 2 hours at a time. Have no complaints at all",0
"Good thin Leather Case, not plastic, the phone is thin and nice sitting in your hand",1
"Well not to be to cliche...but this is the pair for you! I want to start off by saying that most if not all other in ear conforming headphones have never stayed in my ears. With whatever I happened to be doing at the time of wearing them, they always eventually slid out, whether just casually listening, running, lifting weights, and biking, they always slid out of my ears eventually. This pair however fits..perfect. And the fit doesn't sacrifice the sound, the sound quality is great compared to a lot of other top notch crazy expensive £100-100 pairs of headphones. I would recommend this in a heartbeat. So if you find yourself in my situation where your ears just seem to hate every existing pair of in ear headphones, look no further, just buy these and everything will work out just right and you'll never see yourself buying another pair again...until you need to replace these, but with the cost being so low that wouldn't be much a problem when the time came anyways, would it?That is all! If you have a budget of £20 pounds you can buy these and still stay under budget, its a steal.Thank you for the fantastic creation.Peace",0
"Really good headphones. The sound quality is excellent. These are terrific in-ear headphones that look and sound awesome. I really like the look of these, quality construction, and come with different sizes of ear tips, so that I can find the most suitable and comfortable size for my ears, after all, I really like listen to music with headphones for a long time",0
"These work better than any others we've tried yet, including an active-noise-reduction set. Sound quality is excellent. They stay in ear canals better than any others we've used, although they too tend to gradually work loose and have to be re-seated every ten or fifteen minutes. They block ambient noise quite well when fully inserted. The price is more than reasonable. We now have three of these; two we use all the time, and one spare. My advice is to keep them clean. I wipe them off after every use and use q-tips to clean the inside of them every few times also. So long as you do that it appears they might last forever",0
"Best fitting earbuds I?ve ever come across. These are pretty wonderful earphones for a nice price. Unlike my other earbuds purchased before, these don?t hurt me and feel very comfortable when I use and I do trust I can use them for a very long time. The button on line is useful, calls can be answered by pressing it and also works for play/pause. The built quality is very worth the price and even beyond my expectation. Awesome product",0
"Love these bracelets. Simple and generous appearance, quick connect Bluetooth, easy to use",0
"For past few years I've had pairs of earbuds, most of them are poor quality in both comfortability and the deliver of the sound quality.I was totally disappointed after many trys.It was not until I get this pairs of earbuds did I realize that this is exactly what I'm looking for, impressive bass and the best wearing experience I've ever own(maybe the size of the silicone ear tips is prefectly fit)In all I love this pairs of delicate earbuds which aslo have powerful function on wired control",0
"These headphones worked as a charm replacing my old generic ones. Despite we are talking about a low-price ones, they made a well product here. Wires are kind of messy, yes, not flat nor anti-knot, but if you are methodical when storing them you could keep them for months without breaking it.Take into consideration that these are in-ear headphones, and you will be isolated from the world with a pretty decent bass and quality. Definitely not recomended for maniac audiophiles, but for a regular guy it does the job decently",0
"In my opinion, these are the best value headphones anyone can buy. They are really cheap and provide amazing sound for their price. They don't sound perfect next to some of the pricier headphones, but great when compared to Skullcandy or other comparably priced buds. In addition they don't contain some of the features which are commonplace on many headphones such as a microphone or wireless Bluetooth connectivity. This is not worth removing a star from the review, however, because they are so cheap. I found these fit really well in my ears. They include three options (sizes) for tips and unless you have really small ears, should fit great.Anyone on a budget looking for some great earbuds should consider these",0
"What a great deal! Not only do these stay in your ear infinitely better than the ones they're replacing, but they also provide a small level of noise reduction. I use these while running and they are exactly what I was looking for. I no longer have to really crank up the sound or worry about the earbud flipping out of my ear. You do have to take one out to talk to someone or you'll catch yourself yelling at them. For this price, I might need to get some backups!",0
"This tiny speaker has amazing sound...I have it linked to my echo dot...the dot sounds a little tinny without an additional speaker...plus with this speaker I can take it from one room to another...nice clean sound...no vibration plus a really great price...don't think twice...just buy it",0
"I bought these headphones when I lost my apple earpods. I wanted something that had good quality, especially bass, the sound of these earbuds is wonderful and it is great about getting rid of outside noise. they stay in my ears very well during heavy exercise, and are hardy despite their very lightweight features. Very happy with the purchase and is probably one of the better value headphones you can buy",0
"Simply the best bang for your buck ear buds. Choose the correct pad size for your ears - makes a huge difference when you have a snug fit. Unless you've got Clark Kent hearing and Lex Luther cash to burn",0
"Bluetooth speaker feels very solidly constructed and durable. Rubber accents feel very nice in the hand. Speaker has nice weight to it but not heavy. The biggest surprise is the sound...these sound great for the price, and get louder than you would expect. Will fill your room with sound.Overall, these are a very good value and u will be pleased to know that u got more than your money's worth",1
"Still great after a month. I bought two of these for my husband and I. A month ago, the left side of my headphones started to sound a little lower than than right, but its still great. My husband has had no issues with his. The best part about these is how great they fit my ear. I have always had issues with other headphones because of the fit. These are also great if you are working and you sweat. They rarely fall out. For the price, these definitely deserve 5 stars!!!",0
"this is my first review on a product ,and i have to share my thoughts so other can see about how good this product is,these are the nokia 3310 of earphones, just bought 2 more pairs . and i still using my old one for workouts ,after pulling them with my weights by accident ,the dog chewin them ,the sweat , and more ,these are still working!!! i spent a lot of money in earphones ,beats ,monster,skullcandy,brainwaves you name it ,i used them all ,and they all failed, but this earphones still work ,and with an awesome sound . for its price ,durability ,sound and how they fit this is the best you can get !",0
"I was histant to writing a review because i know if all the good reviews keep coming like there are now, the price can skyrocket. but since i've bought 3 pairs of these, i will review. THEY ARE FANTASTIC! Sound quality is awsome, the length of the cord is perfect for athletes so they can leave it in thier shorts and wear them without worrying about that little 'tug on your ear when you run. The only problem is the quality it is made of. They seem like they can rip real easily but thats why you need to take care of these, since they are so awsome for the price. Pleeeeease don't raise the price on these. By birthday il buy like 12 or something. Lol i dont want to encourage bad reviews either so they ruin the good backround these headphones been getting so keep the good reviews coming. KEEP THE PRICE NO HIGHER THAN 7 PLEASSSSEEE",0
"I received these in the mail a couple of days ago and I really like them! They are super cute and feel comfy in me ears. I usually have problems with other headphones because they tend not to fit well in my ears because they are too big or just awkwardly uncomfortable in my ears. AND the pink color is very pretty :) I'd recommend these to anyone who is looking for simple and comfy headphones.",0
"A great fitness tracker that works very well.The strap is comfortable to wear for a long time.This fitness tracker looks great, has a clear easy to read screen when indoors,It can connect with your iPhone or Android Phone through Bluetooth and a SmartWatch App, the App has various functions like various fitness activities and fitness goals for you to achieve.Setting up the device is simple,easy to use and easy to charge.For the price this fitness tracker is actually amazing. The strap is comfortable and the digital screen is nice and bright. Overall score I give is 10/10, great fitness watch with a great price.",0
"I bought plenty of these and they've never failed me. Ever time I get a pair someone likes them so much I let them have them. Can't go wrong with these. They have good sound, stay in my ear, and don't break easily. Have recommended it to anyone I know who needs new earbuds",0
"I was very skeptical when I received this, I destroyed my £80 pair of Monster earphones at work by accident & decided to get a cheap replacement to hold me over. The packaging & earphones themselves look rather cheap, maybe even low quality.But boy was I wrong, they may not be flashy like most high end earphones but it easily makes up for it in quality. I have a very active job & strength train 5 times a week & these have special curvature for the ear so they firmly stay in place, even with movement. The sound itself is quite good, doesn't sound or feel cheap! Easily the best & least expensive earphones I've ever purchased",0
"Ridiculously FAST Shipping! Amazon is the BEST! These earphones sound GREAT for the price. I brought them for my PS Vita and you can definitely tell the difference. I didn't realize the Vita had so much Bass until I put these on. It makes MLB The Show 13 feel like you're at a real baseball game, in the stadium. PS Vita must use Dolby Digital sound, or at least that's what these earphones make it sound like! Very Happy with my purchase and for the price you can't beat it!",0
"These are possibly the best ear-buds I have owned. I bought these based on all the positive reviews and I'm glad I did. I am really amazed at how comfortable these are. I have always had issues finding ear-buds that fit in my ears and don't make them hurt after a while. These sit very comfortably and I'm able to wear them for hours on end. Sound quality is ok. Not for the audiophile, but it does the job for casual listening. The cord is a little short to use for a computer, so I had to buy 3.5mm extension.Pros:- Comfortable- CheapCons:- Cord is short if using for a computer- Not the greatest sound quality",0
"These Ear Buds are very comfortable, I can leave them in my ears for hrs without any noticeable discomfort. The sound is greatfor this price as well. If you listen to Heavy Metal music, the bass sound on these ear buds is incredible. They also stay in your ears whileexercising, jogging, or lifting the weights. These this brand Earbuds replaced my old Sony Earbuds which were over 6yrs old and out-performed them by a wide margin. If you're looking for some quality earbuds, check these out now!	",0
"They have great sound,compatible with many kinds of music.Metal shell is very low profile,so it seems to be durable.Only issue is that the dual driver earbuds is little expensive",0
"Granddaughter is very happy she demo'ed it for me and I must say it is pretty cool!!!",0
"The 'Coredy AC1200 Dual Band Mini WiFi Range Extender Wireless Repeater Wi-Fi Signal Booster with 2 Ethernet Port / Smart LED Indicator (802.11ac 5GHz 867Mbps+300Mbps 2.4GHz Internet Booster)' is a great WiFi extender. Highly recommended.I needed the WiFi extender because there's a room in the house that gets poor WiFi connection and the Coredy WiFi Extender does exactly that and does it well. its also helpful it being duel band so you can receive 2.4Ghz as well as 5Ghz. It has a smart LED signal indicator to help you find the ideal place to plug it in.It is extremely easy to set up. The quickest way is to press the WPS button on the extender and modem and it should be connected. If your modem doesn't have a WPS button it alternatively is accessible using most devices.This Dual band WiFi extender helps to improve and extend the signal strength of hard to reach places, getting rid of any WiFi dead zones. This is great for any areas of the house with poor connection. You can even put it near the garden to use your phone or laptop etc. while you're relaxing outside.The Coredy WiFi booster has 3 functions: extender, access point and router and also works with Amazon Alexa/Echo as well so you can use it in places it couldn't reach before. This allows you to have smoother online gaming and internet signals in rooms that have poor connections without the use of the WiFi booster..This WiFi booster is a small but powerful device. It takes up 1 wall plug and if you plug it into a double socket you can still use the other plug socket without any problems. The only thing that may get in the way if you have one of the 4 (3dBi) external antennae but those are easy to move without effecting the boosting capabilities.The contents of the box you receive includes:? 1× WiFi extender plug? A warranty card? 1× RJ-45 Ethernet Cable? A user manual? 1× Reset pin.This comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, 12 month worry free replacement warranty.

"This lighter is black with zinc alloy detailing which gives it a nice, smart look (not plastic like most standard lighters). The design is fit for men and women. It uses no gas, just electricity to make the 2 arcs. This means that it is wind proof, due to it being flameless, so you don't need to seek shelter in the wind when lighting up cigarettes or cigars etc.The box that the lighter comes in matches the design of the lighter (black with bronze coloured lettering). The lighter is also pre-charged so you can use/test it as soon as its out the box.When you do eventually need to charge the lighter, there's a micro USB that is included with the lighter. The micro USB is used with most (if not all) android devices so you can use any of those chargers too. From flat to full, the charging takes around 2 hours and can last up to a week or 300 sparks with its lithium battery.When charging, the blue light flashes when it is charging and stays a solid blue when fully charged. When the battery is getting low, there's a red light to indicating that it needs to be charged.It has a decently sized cap which keeps it child safe when charging or not in use.It is very simple to use. All you need to do is flip the top and press the button. (The lighter will not spark when lid is closed.) The arc only lasts a couple of seconds (long enough to light up whatever you're smoking) and then stopped automatically to prevent unnecessary battery loss.The dimensions of the lighter is (cm) 7.3×2.8×1.1 and weighs about 70g. If you'd seen someone else with one of these, you wouldn't think it only costs £15.99, it looks more valuable then what it is.I would highly recommend this lighter to anyone fed up with your standard gas lighters blowing out in the wind.",0

"My daughter recently left home to live in student accomadation at university so i thought she might find this a useful addition to her kitchen No doubt her kitchen will not be a large and since she will be cooking for herself this little mini food processor might be just what she needs. I thought I would give it a quick road test myself first.Using the device could not be simpler. Put the food items into the bowl, place the lid and blades in position, fit the bottom of the motor housing unit into the groove on the lid top and holding the unit in place press down on one of the 2 large buttons on the top of the motor. The first button is for slow speed and the second is for the high speed setting I found the 300w motor converted my ice cubes to snow in just a few seconds and an onion was finely chopped in equally quick time. I see no reason why it should not be able to cope with all the culinary chopping and dicing needs of a single person or couple.The mini chopper comes with a silicone base ring to keep the unit from sliding around when in use/4 sharp blades to make light work of any chopping you want to do/a good quality reasonably sized glass bowl and 2 speed settings so that you have all the power you need for chopping all kinds of vegatables.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button.

"This is my review of : Potato Masher, Stainless Steel Potato Masher by Froid Epoch,Good Grips Smooth Potato Masher Use for Vegetables,Fruits and Baby FoodExcellent masher. Sturdy materials; better quality stainless steel than any other mashers I have previously owned, and the horizontal grip is more user friendly than the more common vertical handle. Mashing potatoes is easier and quicker than traditional styles, helped by the heavier weight and larger surface area of the blade. Have tried with potatoes and swede so far, but see no reason why it should not cope just as well with other vegetables.So if you want a great masher for any vegetable this will do the job 100%!",1
"This is my review of : Car Jump Starter RAVPower 8000mAh, Car Battery Booster with 300A Peak Current (for All 12V 2.0 L Gas Engines), Phone Portable Power Bank with Quick Charge 3.0, Built-In LED FlashlightThe 'Car Jump Starter RAVPower 8000mAh, Car Battery Booster with 300A Peak Current (for All 12V 2.0 L Gas Engines), Phone Portable Power Bank with Quick Charge 3.0, Built-In LED Flashlight' is made from great quality materials and feels sturdy well built.This is a very handy gadget to have either in the glove box, door pockets or the center arm rest storage without it taking up much space at all. It is very small and mobile for what it does.A neighbour of mine actually needed to use this. She came round because the battery on her car was completely flat as it had been standing unused for over a month. I took it over to her car, clipped it onto the battery and it started right up first time without any issues.The great thing about this small devise is you don't need another car, nearly bumper to bumper, awkwardly reaching across. You can just connect it up and start the car. Extremely simple. Just don't put the leads on the wrong way. The contents include: ?1× 8,000 mAh power bank (capable of producing, at peak, 300A of current) ?1× Micro USB charging cable ?1× Jump leads (red for + black for -) ?1× Mesh carry bag (unfortunately the leads do not fit in with it) ?1× User manual",1
"Surprisingly the user manual is in perfect English and contains easy to follow instructions which can't be said for other products.For what the power bank is capable of it is quite light and mobile compared to others you may find. On the device you will find an input (for the micro USB) for charging the power bank, an output USB (to charge other devices such as phones ect.), an output socket for the jump leads under a rubber flap for protection and to keep water out and on the face of the power bank the power button.The power button, when pressed once will show the battery life left in the battery, indicated with blue LED lights on the face of the power bank in 25% increments (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). When held for 3 seconds, the bright LED torch will turn on. When the torch is on, press the power button to change modes from on, warning (flashing) and to SOS in case of an emergency then off. Also, the torch is great for finding the battery terminals at night.When charging the power bank from flat to fully charged takes around 2 hours and will provide around 3 jump starts on 1 full charge. When jumping the car, the power bank provides 300A of current (at its peak).If your battery pack is running low, and in emergency situations, you can connect another power bank to the jumper power bank using the micro USB input and do it that way. Although not recommended.RAVPower takes safety of customers and their products very seriously. The power bank/car jumper has a temperature sensor for 'optimal fire detection' which protects the power bank (and you) from reverse polarity (wrong leads on the terminals) and protection against over current, over loading, too much voltage and over charging.Finally, the RAVPower power bank/car jumper comes with a 30 day money back guarantee and an 18 month warranty.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button.

"This is my review of : NP-F550 RAVPower Camera Battery Charger Set for Sony Cameras (2-Pack Replacement Battery Kit, Dual Slot Charger with Micro-USB Input, 3 Ways to Recharge, 2900mAh, Fully Compatible with Original)The 'NP-F550 RAVPower Camera Battery Charger Set for Sony Cameras (2-Pack Replacement Battery Kit, Dual Slot Charger with Micro-USB Input, 3 Ways to Recharge, 2900mAh, Fully Compatible with Original)' is an amazing rechargeable battery pack set made from quality materials.It is very handy to have a couple of extra batteries for your camera, perfect for travelling especially if you pair it with a solar powered power bank. That's why I recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable rechargeable battery set for a reasonable price of £23.99.",0
"The charging is a little slower than expected, however, because you now have 3 batteries, there's no need to worry about it because by the time you've used the one battery up, the other batteries will be ready to be used.",0
"There are 3 ways to charge your batteries. You can charge it using a plug, power bank or charge it in the car whilst you're driving. The batteries are 2900 mAh compared to the original 2200 mAh battery that comes with Sony cameras. So they last about 3.5-4 hours instead of (approx) 2 hours",0
"RAVPower takes safety of its customers and their products seriously. This is why the Sony rechargeable battery pack has protection against over charging/discharging, too much voltage, short circuits and over heating as well as being designed to be a fire resistant build.And for the cherry on top, the battery set comes with an 18 month warranty as well as a 30 day money back guarantee.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button.

"This is my review of : Anjou Ultrasonic 200mL Aroma Diffuser with Mist Control Essential Oil Diffuser for 12H Use ( Low Water Auto Shut-Off, 4 Timer Settings, 7 Colorful LED Lights and BPA-Free )I love this combined aroma/essential oil diffuser and mood lamp - its one of the best I've used and has a very nice finish to it as well as being well built and very sturdy.This diffuser is really stylish and is made from white plastic. The top has a gentle swirling design going all the way around it.Only the top peak is uncovered so that the lamp can let the mist out when you have it turned on and the frosted plastic will let it give out, a nice warm atmospheric glow.its very easy to set up, you just take the lid off, fill up the tank with water using the measuring beaker which comes included, put in a few drops of your chosen aromatherapy oil/fragrance, put the lid back on and plug it in with the UK 3 pin plug which comes with it and you're ready to fill your home with your chosen fragrance and the air-purifying mist. This is great for any dry rooms or areas in the house and it really improves the air quality as well as giving a lovely fresh feeling and aroma.The unit can be used in mist mode or purely in light mode only. It is really lovely in just the light mode and its very relaxing to watch it change colours. There is a mist on/off button on the front as well as a light on/off button. There is also a timer switch to set it to 1h,3h or 6h after which it will turn off. The unit is very safe to use as when the water runs out it turns off automatically.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button. Thanks",0
"This is my review of : RAVPower Rechargeable Battery Pack for Dyson Handheld Vacuum Cleaners (2000mAh Replacement Battery Cell with Fully Compatibility for Dyson DC31, DC34, DC35, DC44, and 917083-01 models)The 'RAVPower Rechargeable Battery Pack for Dyson Handheld Vacuum Cleaners (2000mAh Replacement Battery Cell with Fully Compatibility for Dyson DC31, DC34, DC35, DC44, and 917083-01 models)' is an excellent battery pack for your Dyson hand held vacuum.For a penny under £24 this rechargeable battery pack is roughly half the price of an OEM battery pack. This is compatible with Dyson type A battery powered vacuums (Not compatible with type B models).With it being a 2000 mAh lithium-ion battery, it has more power and more reliability than the original battery. With it being a better battery than the original, it also out performs the original battery when it comes to cleaning performance.The rechargeable battery pack is surprisingly more reliable than the original. It is estimated the battery will have about '2 to 3 years life span (or up to 500 charge/discharge cycles) which I found.Even though its lower in price, RAVPower takes safety of its customers and their products seriously. The battery pack comes with 3 lines of safety. This being over current protection, temperature control switch (to prevent overheating) and a thermistor to ensure the life span if the battery pack to be a long and safe operation to protect you, the battery and your vacuum. This is certified by CE, RoHS and FCCOverall this is a great alternative to the manufacturers more expensive part.If you found my review helpful please click on the YES button. Thanks",0
"Very pleased with the kit for the price and the service was excellent.",1
"Not recommended for a beginner!",1
"Highly recommended.",0
"Have not made this yet but looking at reviews and the parts in the box it will be one of Revells best, just like the Revell Arado Ar196B",1
"Fits together really well and looks fantastic when finished. If you do buy this you can make it straight from the box and the detail is excellent or you you can go mad and super detail the engine etc.",1
"Just a few tips if buying this kit: I would recommend deciding before you start how you wish to display the wings and then go through the instructions and cross out sections that are not relevant to your choice. Make sure to also pay particular attention to fitting the exhausts onto the engine near the bulkhead as it is easy to fix the exhausts out of line with the recesses for the exhausts in the fuselage.PS if you like this I would also recommend Revell model kit 04869 Fw 190 F8.",1
"I've ordered from Models4Hobbies before and always had good service.The model itself looks like a re boxing of an old Protar kit which is good news as i've always liked Protar kitsOver 500 pieces including lots of screws and pipes and other material in their own small neat box, good sharp level of detail of parts, this is a kit that will take a lot of patience and time to complete and therefore not for the inexperienced modeler.Although quite expensive I would in my opinion say its at least as good as a Tamiya 1/12 scale car kit and they can cost hundreds of pounds.Overall I would recommend this if you are an experienced modeler.",1
"Very happy with purchase",0
"my last one opened vertically and had to be charged while open.",0
"Very easy to install, sound is not the best but considering the price it is well above the quality of more expensive units. Can be connected to the out av red/white sockets on the back of your tv to so you can use it with anything that is being played on your tv; sky,xbox or even normal tv channels. All leads are supplied to get you set up. The only tiny, tiny thing I would say (but i'm really struggling to find fault) is that when you change volume on the supplied remote, there is no visible way to tell if the unit is responding to the input, perhaps if the units blue light flashed to show the volume was being adjusted it would have been handy, but i really am nitpicking here! But over all very good, very highly recommended",0
"I have had these for 3 months. They have withstood all sorts of abuse, and sound as good as the day I got them! Which is pretty good!- Good sound quality. Good bass.- They stay securely in my ears. They are also very comfortable. Other earbuds fall out and/or hurt, I can wear these for hours with ease.- They block just enough outside noise that you can listen to your music in peace, but they aren't absolutely noise canceling so you are able to have some awareness of your surroundings.- I have sweated all over these, even washed them, with no damage to them!These are by far the best earbuds I have ever used",1
"Perfect for my needs. Highly recommended seller",0
"I would buy any brand of cheap earbuds, but they would fray before I'd finish using them.Then I would exclusively buy Gummy brand because the sound quality was no different, but the rubber sheath covering the cord would last much longer.Then the last Gummy gave out after a year or so and someone somewhere on the internet suggested these earbuds.The difference in sound quality is amazing! I didn't realize I'd been listening to poor quality sound for years until I bought this last month. They are a couple dollars more than the Gummy and they are worth it",1
"Sound is great, I really enjoy is Headset. The Vibration is great forand game or music that has a lot of bass",0
"Works brilliantly!However, I got it in my eyes and inhaled it and almost had an asthma attack. It does have a warning on the back, but I never expected to have such a violent reaction to it. I'll be using it outdoors with eye protection and a mask from now on.",1
"Too big, got horribly dirty instantly",1
"Not battery powered, not as fun as battery versions",1
"Designed for child like hands? Tiny, extremely inaccurate. Don't get the high ratings",1
"Just what I needed",1
"A must have for any goth with cats",1
"Better than the three sea shells method",1
"Top notch, except buds come off too easily, one got stuck inside my ear, had to use tweezers to remove it!",1
"Excellent bang for buck",1
"Smell great, effectively masks the smell of my farts in my room when my girlfriend is over",1
"Made my face a red, blotchy, itchy mess",1
"Fine but I'm positive I received refurbished items and not new ones, there was a finger print on one and they were muddled up, packet wasn't sealed either",1
"That's a fidget spinner alright, got one for my son, latest fad, this has a decent weight to it. Only flaw is the middle clips come away too easily and will be lost",1
"Cannot be used to exercise with. Strap pops off arm when flexed, the Velcro is weak. Can't use it for running/weight lifting. No point even having it because you can't use headphones with it (unless Bluetooth).Haven't tried it in water, and I won't because I'm returning it.",1
"simple, great tie, can't go wrong",1
"Nice, a bit unfomfy, but a nice summer shoe",1
"Not bad, the pins that hold the cigarettes down are a tad flimsy",1
"Makes my skin greasy, spotty and blotchy",1
"A previous batch I bought did not foam up, this one does. Weird",1
"This thing jams constantly, and the expensive ink only lasts 5 minutes",1
"These things never work for me, had my eyes tested and my eyesight is fine. Probably because you can't adjust focal length",1
"Wish it were battery powered",1
"These are too fluid, they allow the sides to become misaligned so you have to straighten the side out before you can turn it. Annoying.",1
"All I wanted was replacement blades. Wish they sold two blades for £20 instead of these cups which I already had.",1
"The screws it came with were terrible, they stripped far too easily. Luckily I had the typical drawer full of crap.",1
"Came with a pamphlet that never had any details on how the thing works???",1
"My cat seemed to love it, but it gave him diarrhea unfortunately, stopped giving him it and he was fine again. Maybe a coincidence, but would rather not risk it with an old cat.",1
"This review isn't based on this particular juicer.I was new to juicing, bought this one.Juicing is messy, impractical, uneconomical and stinks.The juicing process throws this horrible smell into the air, the juice itself is rough, burns the throat, no matter which food you juice. I'd avoid juicing and just blend food and have smoothies, sweetended with not from concentrate AJ.This particular machine requires 6 different pieces be cleaned after use, takes forever.",1
"You get what you pay for.No sight of android 7.0 in sight.Screen scratches VERY easily.Standard USB C cables don't fit unless modified by shaving 1mm of plastic off.Phone only scores 60000 on Anantech benchmark.Key press accuracy is off.GPS has to be recalibrated every time you open google maps.You have to mess around with the mobile network to get 3G to work with Three.Camera is poor.No front facing light.Battery and performance could be MUCH better if optimized by company.Apart from that its a good phone, most issues could be solved by more diligent android developers at UMI.",1
"Something in this gives me red blotches on my skin, I stuck with it for over a week and its only gotten worse",1
"I'm having the opposite problem, I normally wear medium but this felt like a small? I'm 5'11, athletic build",1
"Great, does exactly as expected. However it will take a while to see if it does improve the skin or not, we'll see",1
"Nice glasses, but they made no difference except they gave me eye strain, I think blocking light causes the eyes to try harder to let in more light under normal circumstances",1
"This made my skin red and blotchy and itchy, going to try the sensitive stuff",1
"Excellent, can't believe how well they work. Simplified eating healthy when I can't be bothered to cook",1
"Cuts into your armpits, very uncomfortable",1
"Finally getting around to this. Bought this and the end of it bent extremely easily, didn't return it in time, almost forgot about it until I found it recently. Poor quality",1
"The ends are solid, good for adults, will make children cry!",1
"The Matte box clips all snapped off during assembly, maybe something to do with the cold? But they were brittle and broke off with no effort whatsoever when trying to attach them",1
"Bought these after seeing so many great reviews, was very uncomfortable, and the mic can't be bent to be closer to your mouth, people would always complain they couldn't hear me so I'd have to hold the end closer to my mouth manually all the time, sucked",1
"Build quality is good, comes prebuilt... However, I can't see anything and the image is blurry as hell, plus there's no instructions on what the rubber band is for. Also it cuts into my nose quite badly.There's no way to adjust the distance the phone is at either.I have a Nexus 5x.Film removed from lenses, lenses cleaned",1
"Cheap, nasty, barely functions, doesn't work. Etc, I want to return it but I can't.",0
"These are not self adhesive! This is the second time this has happened",1
"Stupidly thought these would have adhesive on the back, the do not and require glue",1
"Nice boots, laces are that crap, waxed cylindrical type so could benefit from a set of decent flat laces.I am a size 9 sometimes a 9.5, ordered a size 9, and they fit perfectly. (I wear thin socks).The biggest issue I have is the sole, it has had a noticeable wear in just over a week of daily use, maybe walking an hour per day outside, which is disappointing to say the least..Apart from that they are comfortable, they feel good to walk in, and they feel nice and sturdy",1
"Been using it for nearly a week.The product is like water, it smells like glue, and is also sticky.I don't understand what's wrong? nobody else complains about any of these things",1
"These do the job they're designed to do and they do it well .They're not obtrusive and perform very well, they're loud too",1
"It may be just a string of lights but it is my best purchase of the year.It ways nothing, unpacks down to nothing and for the dark months ahead when fishing its going to prove invaluable.I love it and I'm sure many more anglers alike will love this.",1
"Just received this item and for £10 its remarkable, a real bargain. I'm not sure its 6 watts as suggested its certainly not any clearer/better than my anker 3 watts cube speaker but its less than half the price and size, so its still a great little purchase",1
"These are blinding, I love them they're much better than some others I've tried, really great sound I'm pleased with my purchase. They get better with age I've found",1
"After a few months of use I can come to the conclusion they don't work properly on some laptops, might just be a codec thing. They're also a bit short on base and over compensate on the mids and highs",1
"This was a great purchase, its been opened straight away. Filled the base with water and started playing, well with the laughter and cheating and usual family bonding this swing ball has been a hit!",1
"Quality built guard does what its intended to do, I can't fault any lixada product's I own, in a handy carry bag also",1
"Perfect little pad! Light and takes up very little space.Came quickly #chuffed",1
"Well I'm writing a review on a towel, what has my world become?But this an item that is worthy of a review in my eyes and in everyone else's I see that has also felt the need to share their experiences of this towel.Well I got mine for one reason and that's to abuse whilst fishing so I got the brown so it will hide a multitude of sins be it fish slim, mud, washing up dirt from camping and drying off once wet, this towel will do it all and without growing extra mould when forget to wash after every session due to its antibacterial properties.Its large enough to dedicate a corner of the towel to each task, just try not to forget which corner that it is, but its got logo's so keep that for wiping the face and you won't go far wrong.Also comes in a nice stuff sack so can be place away dirty whilst keeping everything else clean.This is a must for all angler's especially carp angler's that get shouted at for ruining the wife's teatowels and bath towels everytime you grace the bank this really is a great bit of kit that you really can't do without, its as essential as your rods reels and brew kit.You won't regret it",1
"Worked why they lasted, but in fairness not treated with any respect, pulled from pillar to post on a daily basis. As expected the longest lead broke first and then so on",1
"Don't bother the box is trash the company won't help you there are no updates and its no more a box than it is a coaster",0
"This android TV box is serving me well currently and has been a joy to use, the remote that came with is better than most but still you need a keyboard remote in my opinion. I found it better than some others and would replace it with probably the same box again if I needed to as its coped with everything I've throw at it.",1
"My boy loves this watch its on his every day, he's a lad of 10 and its standing the test of time, excuse the pun!",1
"Well I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't what I got! What I received is way above my expectations it is brilliant, there's no movement in the waterproof housing and the settings menu a child could operate. A massive amount of extras all boxed in well above standard packaging. Fully charged and ready to go. It really is brilliant piece of kit and for £45 it can not be beaten in my opinion. Yes there may be others but I certainly don't think you can get this quality at this price point and I looked. I was that impressed I wrote this review less than 24hrs after ordering. I will update after extensive testing. But wow just wow!",1
"Brilliant nail clippers, worked very well.Built well enough I could see them lasting but only time will tell.Used on a bulldog and made light work of it.",1
"its a ball and it bounces! Oh and its a pricey ball that bounces!",1
"Big disappointment, I thought I was getting the best middle/top of the range smart box after much deliberation and hours of review reading I thought I'd nailed it with this X6 android box and in the first instance I wasn't wrong when it turned up.Nice packaging, a smart logo stamped box with the device it self separately packaged from the remote and extremely short UK plug.No batteries supplied but to be fair I didn't expect them.On setting up the box for the first time I was very pleased to see an instant update, which shows OTA is not a gimmick to get the customer but that they actually care for the customers and the feedback they receive and that the OTA extends the life of the machine by regular updates and any faults quickly rectified. But for me that's where the love for this machine soon stopped.The remote was shocking I found I couldn't be further than a foot away and had to be directly in front.This I'm sure they're aware of because there's an app to use on your phone which was in my view was just as bad.Very limited where you can place this box as its a mere 2ft long.The firmware and software were out gunned by an old mbox that was less than half the price and no where near the process power.its now been sent back as I'm afraid online updates are not enough to carry this box to a top box status for me, and the search goes on!	",1
"What a fantastic keyboard remote finally! I haven't got completely used to it just yet as I've only received it 12hrs ago. I felt compelled to right a glowing review for it as I know kodi is becoming more and more common and don't think people should purchase a less capable keyboard/remote as I have many times before this one",1
"As per the other reviews this is a magnificent item. A very well thought out vape made with excellent material and presented beautifully.From order to post took less than 24hrs ordering direct, postage was in a protective envelope with a small greeting thanking you for your custom.I've now had the pleasure of conversing with the company and they are very much all about the customers and offering them the best products at the best possible prices. I really can see where all the positive feedbacks are coming from, I'm glad I took the time to read the reviews prior and to purchase from XVX.",1
"Brilliant, 50ft of quality speaker wire",0
"This is the business! for any carp angler, fisherman,hiker, camper,trekkers etc honestly this is a must they're simply brilliant",1
"Great sound but feel they've cut corners and have been made cheaply which is no shock when you look at the price, but this is a real shame because what you do get from these headphones is a rich well balanced sound which really makes up for the lack of quality. All said and done though the sound is very good!	",1
"its brilliant, it really is a a brilliant well built piece of kit, met my expectations and more",0
"One of the connections broke pretty quickly.Earphones really need to be designed in a more durable way.",1
"Broke after a while",1
"Much more durable than my last one, also plenty of space and easy to secure tightly",1
"Quite scratchy and uncomfortable. Doesn't seem to really be removing any dead skin either (probably just because I don't have much).But still I don't think I'll really use it much, maybe if the bristles got softer over time it might not be quite as bad.Maybe the gloves you can get might be softer.",1
"Works perfectly at keep my super soft blanket on my bed as a sheet.This is the blanket I use, highly recommend it to anyone, its insane how soft it isLuxury Soft Faux Fur Warm Non-Allergic Bed Sofa Throws Blanket Roll Mink Sofa Bed Throw (King, Choclate)",0
"Everything fine",1
"Bit overhyped, they're not really all that soft. But still decent sheets.",1
"Was fine but then stopped working, maybe water got into it?Even though its supposed to be waterproof",1
"Material could be a bit softer, and too small to use as a bandana.But for 3 quid you can't really complain too much.",1
"One of the earphones stopped working after not even using them very much.Why can't earphones actually be durable.",1
"its basically the same volume as my phone speaker so no point really even using it.Not sure how it has such great reviews.Maybe mine is faulty? I doubt it though.",1
"Good, but seems to be way cheaper here:https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vinteky-Rechargeable-Portable-Cordless-Handheld/dp/B01J3H9GZU/",0
"Works really well and easy to use.Only concern is that the nozzle part may not be completely airtight.",1
"I love this toothpaste because it has pretty much no taste, so I don't dread brushing my teeth anywhere near as much.Most other toothpaste makes your entire mouth taste super minty for ages and takes forever to wash the taste out.",1
"Quite overrated imo.The back is really vertical and there's load of resistance when you try to lean back, which means you can't really relax in it.",1
"Could probably do with some cord thing to hang it from the top of the inside of a tent.",1
"Takes forever to warm up, but works fine once its going",1
"Readings just aren't reliable enough, they randomly fluctuate depending on the surface you put them on and stuff",1
"No issues after half a year.Although be careful when putting it in because you can cut your hands on the metal shelf things.",1
"Seems pretty good quality.But the shortest setting isn't really short enough.Also if you use it without the guard on you can cut yourself.",1
"Quite hard to properly inflate since the air leaks out as soon as you blow it up, but otherwise pretty cool.Kinda weird, but what you can do is blow it up and then close the nozzle using your tongue to stop most of the air leaking out.",1
"Pretty good chair, but arms aren't adjustable and even when you put the tilt thing on its loosest setting its still way too hard to lean back on it, you have to have your feet on the desk or something to be able to push backwards enough.",1
"They're pretty cheap so can't complain too much.But when you arrange them into a rectangle the ones at the ends don't stick together properly which makes it virtually impossible to get them into a cube shape which is really annoying.",1
"The bells are actually really noisy, so you'll probably want to put some paper inside them or something if you don't want them to make tons of noise.But other than those issues, they're fairly comfortable and look kinda cool.",1
"Foam things felt a bit too big for my ears, and the rubber ones it comes with are quite hard to put on.Sometimes the IP/NK switch will accidentally be moved and make the audio sound messed up until you switch it back.Other than that they've been completely fine so far though",1
"It does get boring pretty quickly, but that's more just the nature of the product that its something you'd only use occasionally.Not really any faults with the product other than that occasionally some needles can get stuck, but if you give it a little shake they go down.",1
"Really nice wallet.Only have some minor criticisms of it, like one of the note compartments has a hole in the bottom which is like the size of a 10p, so coins in that compartment could fall out the bottom.The supposed 'coin compartment is only big enough to fit 2 fingers in so getting coins out is super fiddly, I feel like they could've maybe made it a little longer, or just use a horizontal zip instead of a vertical one.And on the card holder compartments there are a few plasticy strands which are fraying on mine that would have to be removed and could potentially cause the material to separate if it happened more.Might be personal preference but I think I would've liked a button/zip/velcro thing to keep the wallet closed",1
"The quality of the gallium is fine, but beware, its not really worth buying tbh, just watch a video of it instead.its extremely messy, I put it into a glass bowl and even after putting boiling water beneath it the metal stays stuck to the glass so its really hard to get most of it back in the tube.What you have to do to clean it up is get some aluminium foil and scrape it on the gallium which makes them react and it comes off easily, unfortunately this means you wont be getting that part of the gallium back though so you'd only be able to use it a few times and it takes some cleaning.",1
"Worked fine for now, we'll see if the puncture repair lasts, I think it should be fine though.And £1.29 with delivery is super cheap",1
"Bought the regular pillow pair rather than the firm one, but they're still extremely firm.So don't feel very comfortable, I'd prefer much softer ones.Reviews seem quite overrated, but they're fine if you like firm pillows.",1
"Its decent but doesn't feel super comfortable to use.The lights for Num/Caps Lock/Scroll Lock partially light other ones up which is a bit annoying.Honestly the light up background on the keyboard keys is also pretty annoying, its kinda cool for a couple hours but I've just had it turned off since I bought it now since its not useful.Some of the keys were swapped round, as in they weren't typing what was written on them (still can't get the pound sign fixed)but here's my autohotkey code which I run on startup to sort out the swapped keys:#singleinstance force;Remaps  and ~+'::+2+2::+';Remaps #\::+3;Remaps ~ and |+`::+\+\::+`",1
"Decent headphones but a bit overrated imo, they're not really very comfortableEdit: One of the earphones stopped playing sound after a few weeks unless you have the wire in the exact right spot.",1
"The L/R labels are pretty hard to see, they seem to be symmetrical though (other than the buttons on the cable) so I'm not sure it actually matters which way round you use them. You could memorise that the left one is the one with the volume control on though, so its not really an issue.I'd recommend switching to the small earbuds, they fall out just as easily as the normal ones. But they'll probably be more comfortable if you wear them for a long time.",1
"Seem to be pretty solid earphones, only big downside is that they fall out quite easily.You have to ram them quite far into your ears to make them stay in properly",1
"I'd recommend switching to the small earbuds, they fall out just as easily as the normal ones. But they'll probably be more comfortable if you wear them for a long time.",1
"I love my new ergo fit headphones! The color is my favorite, so that makes me smile, but not nearly as much as it makes me smile to hear my music sound so rich & full, and have NO ear pain from the headphones fitting poorly. I needed the smallest pads, so I'm really glad they came with 3 sizes. A great buy for under $10. Thanks, Amazon for another wonderful shopping experience!",0
"I'm not a sound buff but these little things are great, especially while exercising and stay in place. Super comfortable and came with three different earpiece forms. Overall extremely pleased for the price point.",1
"Fantastic product with LONG battery life. These fit comfortably and are easy to operate. Paired with my phone quickly.Love them and order another one to my girlfriend",0
"Great product, shipping, and communication from seller! Would definitely recommend and buy from again! Thank you so very much for the great experience",0
"I've had these phones for a month now. They are still working. No static. The ear buds are not torn or worn. Only thing I wish they had was a volume control on it, but other then that I'm very happy with my purchase!",1
"Barely larger than a stock Apple cube charger but charges phone and ipads twice as fast. Does get warm but seems durable. Purchased three and all going strong. Foldable plugs great for travel",0
"I probably would have looked over these ear phones 100 times but read an article on a tech site saying they were the best bang for the buck. I primarily use them for my runs. Sound is great and well worth the money",1
"I have sampled a range of earbuds ranging from the best to the worst. And these are the best. There is no doubt in my mind that these will change the way you listen to music. How amazing are they? They're amazing",1
"Better than expected.I love them",0
"I was surprised by the quality and comfort of these earbuds at this price point. I know, everyone wants name brand these days. But, if you're like me and want excellent quality for a great price, these are great",1
"Perfect for my needs. Highly recommended seller",0
"Awesome headphones!!! I bought these for work. I share a very large office another person and needed something to block his constant talking to himself. I have several other Bluetooth sets of headphones be I can't turn them up load enough to dround him out without doing damage to my hearing (I've tried). These work magnificently!!! The sound quality is exceptional, very very close to my Bose headphones but at less than a quarter of the cost. Highly recommend these",0
"If anyone is looking for cheap, but solid headphones, then these are it. Great sound for the price, and they somehow still work after I left them in the washing machine. I have no cons so far on this product",1
"I think these headphones are durable and have clear sound quality, but personally I like my RCA squish black earbuds for sound quality. These have 5 stars specifically for a better fit and durability though",1
"Quality construction of all metal. Great fit on Ausu 2 watch",0
"Impressed with the quality of the sound and the material used",0
"I have previously bought some hi-fi headphones on Amazon which had some serious problems. This one is working perfectly and costing much less. Did I tell you that it even partially cancels the ambient noise?",1
"great portable charger, fast charger",0
"Love these headphones. I've had one pair now for two years before it started wearing down. Just bought 3 more sets as extras but one of them died in under a month. Still love these and won't hold one bad set against it",1
"I love these, especially considering the low cost. Only problem with these is that I lost a few of the rubber ear-pieces, and I am pleasantly surprised that they still work after a month of almost daily use and abuse",1
"Love the design and sound of these earphones. Because of the unique design, they stay in your ears much better than other 'straight designs. Especially useful if you wear earphones while walking or jogging",1
"Not only are these headphones very cheap but they are very strong and the sounds are crisp and perfect. A simple push of both headphones deeper into ears maximizes the sound quality. Try it and see. Highly recommended",1
"its crazy to think these cheap airbuds could sound good, let alone be just about indestructible. I've bought other brands, but none as durable as these. Highly recommend them. I only use these for movies and such",1
"LOUD. I don't know how these does it, but these are louder than my Beats! I don't feel bad about throwing them in my bag because they are quite cheap but give great quality sound. Comfortable and fit in my small ears",1
"I have tried a lot of ear buds and these are my favorite. I lose them about every other month and keep coming back for the quality and price. I love the fit, and love the sound. And for the price you can't beat them",1
"I needed solid ear buds for around ten bucks. Now, I could go to walmart or CVS and buy a cheap pair that hurts my ears. Or I could order these bad boys on amazon for less and better quality. Paid 10 bucks, worth it",1
"Mines kept messing up in the beginning but now they are fine. The quality of these are kinda bad. They feel cheap but then again they are cheap. The sound quality is great but you have to have them well in your ears",1
"I have three pairs of these now and they get the job done. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but these seem durable and have a good shape for everything I need them for (gym workouts, running, at the office, etc.)",1
"i had a samsung pair that when u bought gs3 and these are way better. the prices is perfect way worth it the only thing is for me feels wierd cause i normally wear over the head/ear headphones really good sports pair",1
"Pretty good sound quality for the price. Good definition and response to different equalizer settings. Good bass also AS LONG AS it fits tightly in your ear. You may want to get the bud slightly moist for deep bass",1
"Least money I have ever spent on such great headphones. Thank you seller, thank you. This is all I want to say to you.If these pair ever break, which I doubt will, I will buy the same ones. Buy it, you won't regret",1
"I use them at work to listen to music or podcasts when doing tedious work, and they work great! They are not high-end earphones, but they work as well as others I have had in the past. And for the price, I say A+!",0
"If you want a good quality, everyday set of earbuds, buy these. I've purchased pricey earbuds in the past, thinking that I was getting a superior product but none of them compare to the price/sound/comfort of these",1
"Love these. I think I've bought about 5 pairs now so that I can keep extras around in different places. Good sound and they're able to isolate outside noise pretty well. For the price, I'd definitely recommend them!",1
"I love these earphones. They have completely replaced my Apple earbuds. They are very comfortable and fit snugly in your ears. They also come with three sizes of foam rubber covers to fit different size ear canals",1
"I was blown away by the sound quality for some these Nice priced headphones. 10/10 would buy again! They fit Nice in my ears and do not dislodge during activities. Comfortable and stylish. Definitely recommend",1
"I have bought Bose, Klipsch, etc. of the $50+ headphones. Well, these sounds just as awesome, not to mention how much longer they last without a case and hard use. Highly Recommend for gym use or any hardcore use",1
"I've gone through many headphones trying to find good gym/cycling headphones and they've always been dying on me or just horrible sounding. These are cheap, have lasted me a long while, and actually sound decent",1
"I just can't believe that these ear buds are so inexpensive. Great quality for 3 times the price. I no longer get mad when my children keep taking my ear buds. With 2-day shipping I get my new set immediately",1
"I've used Skullcandy ear buds for years and was perfectly happy replacing them annually. But these are so much better. The sound quality is better and the fit is sublime. You really can't do better for the price",1
"I've tried several earbuds but could never find any that were comfortable to wear for an extended period of time. These are great! I liked them so much that I've purchased several pairs adn given them as gifts",1
"i ordered them cause at the gym i like to work out alone and not hear other people moan and grunt. It throws my focus off. These work great cause I can't hear anyone else, just me and my world working on my body",1
"I originally got a pair of Monster earbuds to pair with my ipod nano. These were picked up as an add-on to an order. These headphones beat the Monster hands down - much more comfortable and sounds much clearer",1
"I use these for running and the gym. They stay in my ears, they come with multiple fittings for ideal fit in ears, and they sound great! For $10, you can't beat 'em. Best bang-for-your-buck headphones out there",1
"My last pair of these lasted close to 6 years, which is a pretty good run for a pair of headphones under $10. Decent sound and very durable. I just got another pair and will likely get another when these break",1
"I know other people who have spent 4 times as much for the same quality. These rock! I wish there was a version with a microphone built in. I lost one of my pairs and doubt a second pair without thinking twice",1
"I listen to my MP3 player for at least 5 hours a day at work. The sound quality from some ear buds can make my head hurt. These ear buds have very good sound quality at a very good price. They are also durable",1
"I'm not an audiophile, but the price is low and the quality is pretty good. Bought them so I would have some cheap headphones I wouldn't mind losing when I had a long train trip, but I've kept using them since.",1
"I have problems finding ear buds that fit my ears, but these are great. I am not necessarily a great judge of sound, but they sound OK to me. And they don't fall out of my ears or have to be jammed into them.",1
"I must say that I've been quite happy with these earphones. The price was super and the quality was commensurately even better than the price. its possible that I will eventually order another pair of these.",1
"I needed headphones that would stay in my ears when I run/exercise and these are perfect! They charge twice as much for similar head phones in the stores. I would buy from this company again. Hope this helps!",1
"I was very disappointed with these earphones. I received them mid-May and by the end of June both the soft rubber pieces covering the earphones had fallen off. Sound quality was also not what I was expecting.",1
"I just received these and they work flawlessly. They completely drown out other sounds. Obviously, I can't change the volume with these, but if you don't need that, I would highly recommend these headphones.",1
"I've had much more expensive headphones than these and these are just as good. Working out, they STAY in your ear and don't ever fall out. They're also pretty good at canceling out noise. Well worth the $10",1
"I love the earphones. They work well for me. I have small ears so they used to hurt when I used to use earphones. But this is really good. It sits well in my ear and doesn't hurt them. It is a good purchase",1
"At first I was attracted by the look, cood design earbuds distinguish from normal apple earbuds, the red&black color is prefectly match.For the sound quality it performed better than the other earbuds I've ever bought, it turely deliver clear sound for multi-style of music no matter the bass/mid or treble.I would definitely purchase it again",0
"Very hard to bend around the corners and must be careful as it could snap and get stuck in the pipe.",1
"Excellent product for live engineers using wireless units. I always knew there must be a battery out there that could last long. Buy the charger that goes with this, other units may damage the battery",1
"Once you buy the battery don't use any unit appart from this unit that is made to charge it. Other units may damage the battery",1
"Hard to bend around corners",1
"Love the 1,2 and 3 albums.Some of the best written songs. Good live recording. I owned this on cassette and it was getting worn so it rarely got played. Now I have these on CD to play at leisure. Amen.",1
"Arrived quickly and worked well until yesterday, will NOT CHARGE ,tried different cables and wall chargers but will not charge. Have binned it DO NOT BUY! Gave it one star as it did initially work well.",1
"Hi can anyone provide contact details for this product? Has been working perfectly but now completely Frozen won't do anything",1
"Post script, phone keeps dropping Bluetooth connection, mid call sometimes, and the display is fading and has vertical lines in it! Any suggestions from the manufacturer?",1
"These boots are coming apart at the back after months - would love to know what the manufacturer thinks as - obviously - we are out of the return period. Not what you expect for such a pricey wellie!!!",1
"Very poor quality the microphone disintegrated within a day",0
"its ok for an FPS game but its not what its designed for so can't put it down for that",1
"Image isn't clear, and washes off more and more with each use",1
"The sound was distorted and the angled jack broke within 2 months.",1
"Good we phones, but cable comes loose when exercising",1
"Cracking speaker good sound and easy to set up",1
"Amazing book !!! I was gutted when i had finished it !! A must read",1
"These are the most comfortable pair of earphones i have ever owned. i usually buy cheaper earphones ($5-$30). I have had a problem with the earphones coming out of my ears while working out. These stay in my ears and feel very secure. The way they fit is very different from other earphones. They shape to fit your ear which makes them so much more comfortable!",0
"This earbuds is pretty cool design with the braided cable, my son love in it when he is playing PS 4, just simply plug it into the controller without installation, size fit with his ears prefetly, he especially love the clear sound via this earbuds so he was turely enjoy playing vedeo game now.Earbuds itself is well-made and looks very durable, great choice in $9.99!!",0
"Really good quality sound, very impressed",1
"I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES! Can't believe they are this cheap! Awesome bass for how small they are, and when combined with the fact that they are 'in-ear, they block out most ALL outside noise and sound great!",1
"Overall good product, thanks! Requires the wearer to adjust from time to time, but that's expected with a magnetic band",1
"This is so small you can stick in your wallet which means you don't have to worry about whether you've got enough space in your bag, etc to take it with you - great idea",1
"Love these so much (we have two in different colours) as they are useful in so many different situations and also very different from other lamps I've seen",1
"Got this as a gift for my 19 year-old daughter and she really loves it and wears it constantly. Most of the anklets with charms that I looked at were a bit childish which is why I went for this one",1
"This is a brilliant little lamp for when you're working with your laptop - love it so much I've just ordered another two for my daughters",1
"I bought this speaker to use in the shower. It is a great size, fits easily on the small shelf in my shower. It has great sound and battery life. I am very pleased with it",0
"These are, hands down, the best pair of in-ear headphones I've ever owned. Luckily, I read some of the reviews on here, so that I could realize the first fact I stated. You must use the rubber ear inserts that fit snugly in your ear. You'll get plenty of fine, clear tones in all the right range if you're wearing them properly.The sound is clear, rich and true, NOT scratchy or squeaky like many cheaper in-ear headphones. I'll leave these in a pocket or something and have my JVC earphones nearby, and they don't even compare to these. I immediately look for these headphones if I want to listen to something clearly. Furthermore, they block out sound almost as well as earplugs with how they fit on myself.Lastly, it seems to me that they are ergonomically designed to fit in the ear better. First: the rubber on the ear-insert is very pliable/soft. Second: the rubber ear-inserts take on a tilted oval shape because of the shape of the earphone speakers themselves. This makes them very comfortable to wear, even with the largest rubber ear-insert size (it comes with 3 sizes of rubber inserts/covers) that makes the best seal. Many, cheaper, in ear headphones are uncomfortable to wear and make your ears sore, but you can wear these all day without something stretching out your ear",0
"These headphones are the best!!! For under £10, I can't believe how good these sound and the fit is so comfortable. These are perfect for running or working out or even casual listening, I love the fit and I have experienced no ear fatigue after wearing it for the whole day. I think the amazing ratings on Amazon for these headphones are completely justified",0
"These are the most comfortable earbuds I have ever tried, and the sound is really great. Would buy again",0
"Impressive, quality headphones!",1
"As soon as I took them out of the box, stuck them in my ears and they are comfortable and sound amazing! Very surprised at the full isolated sound. Would definitely purchase another",1
"I'm 6'2 and my only issue with these is that the cord is SLIGHTLY, and when I say slightly I really mean slightly too short for me. Maybe an inch or so too short. I don't mean they don't reach my head, I just have a preference for some leeway when I put them in my ears. And this feels a lil snugger on the cord than I'm used too. (Not an issue with the product just a preference)#5 Did I mention the price???? £10??? REALLY??????? Jesus these are amazing when you factor this in. I'm considering getting 2 more pairs to keep around at home and in my car for whenever, just because they're so affordable and I get sad when I don't have them on me, but would love to listen to some music.Conclusion;There's a reason why these bad boys are at 4.5 star and reviewed by over 1+k people. They are that good for the price and you would be a fool not to get a pair of these just to have for whenever/whatever. Leave em in your car!!! I grantee you will thank me when you need a pair of ear-buds, but you left your favorite pair at home without thinking. Then, a few seconds into your despair ... 'Oh, that's right!!!! I have a backup pair in my car!!! Thanks random amazon dude! So, you're welcome ahead of time!",0
"I received these on time and in good package condition. The boxing is decent if you would like to buy it as a gift, it came with a well packaged headphone, a charging cable and a audio cable. Everything works well on these and in good sound quality, clear voice and nice bass, I like it",1
"These things are incredible for the price. I've used earbuds regularly for over a months while exercising, while working in landscaping/farming, and presently as an attorney. The different types of work affect sound quality, given the types of ambient noise one experiences, the jostling of the headphones from movement, etc. In addition, I only buy headphones that are no more than £100, preferably less than £10, because I have a tendency to lose and/or destroy them. These are, hands down, the best pair I've ever had, even better than the £100 Beats I used to buy. The fit is perfect, they do not jostle around in your ear, and because the fit is so snug (without being annoying), they eliminate ambient noise extremely well. For example, on a plane you barely notice the engine sound (relative to any other headphones I've owned).And the sound quality is the best I've ever experienced by long shot for a pair of earbuds. The bass is deep and full, mids are actually pronounced, and the treble is not piercing like it is frequently in earbuds. The clarity for something like jazz is not perfect if your an audiophile, but still better than anything else at this price point, or at numerous price points above it.NOTE: In order to maximize sound quality, you have to use the rubber piece that fits snugly into your ear. You also HAVE to wear the R headphone in your right ear and the L headphone in you left ear. I guarantee the reviewers complaining about the lack of bass are not wearing them correctly. When you do, the sound is nothing short of astonishing for pair of budget earbuds",0
"These earphones are a great value for their price. Music quality is great for an in-ear headphone. I ran over my last pair with my car and they survived another month before finally falling apart where I had cracked them.",0
"Noise cancellation works great! They're relatively light weight and the sound is excellent. Bluetooth connectivity is easy. Really helps while studying and need to get rid of the noise",1
"Very good sounding, tied for favorite, see comparisons below to other earbuds. You must pay attention and use the right tip for your ear, as this design does not go deep in ear and thus needs the right rubber tip to get good sound isolation.I compared the ergo-Fit on cell phone and laptop outputs, 6 different songs and the with other earbuds listed below:this brand Ergo-Fit ~£10.These are one of my two favorites due to better fit than HAFX1X and almost as good of sound, slightly better sound than Ink'd but not as good of fit -Bass-Excellent, not too boomy -Mid, Good -Highs, Good, not too much (like Ink'ed) -Comfort, Good, a little bit noticeable, but you can wear for many hours. Noise Isolation fit is good, you need experiment with tips to get it right as these leave no margin for error as they do not go deep into ear canal. However they tend to stay in place.SKULLCANDY Ink'd - £11 Ok, no distortion, sometimes short on bass, good for vocals -Bass, good, but a little weak, if positioned well in ear bass can be good -Mid, Excellent, very clear vocals -Highs, Good, perhaps a little too much volume highs -Fit, Very comfortable and best at noise isolation, fitting deep in ear canal, making them my favorite along with the JVC HAFX1X £25 - Beautiful sounds, well balanced, nice bass -Bass, OK, the best you'll ever experience in earbuds, almost too much. -Mid, Good, very clear vocals, despite a very rich bass -High, Excellent -Fit, I find it difficult to get them just deep enough to get good noise isolation, using the medium tips. But this made them to be uncomfortable and they WORK THEMSELVES LOOSE (from tight noise isolation fit). In general not uncomfortable, but very noticeable in ear due to large sizeMEELECTRONICS M6 - 18£ Very good,clear sound, no distortion, well balanced -Bass, Excellent, rich and natural sound, almost booming -Mid, Excellent, very clear vocals -Highs, Good, clear no distortion -Fit, Only seam to get good noise isolation fit with long triple flanged tip, but these are not comfortable to wear more than an hour or two.PHILIPS SHE6000/28 ~£14 -Balanced high, mid, and low ranges -Fit, comfortable since they don't go into ear much, 4 different size tips. Don't fit tight in ear, as not designed to go deep enough. Thus little noise isolation, and not suited to noisy environment. None-the-less, even though the do NOT seal-in the sound via tight fit, they seem to have good frequency balance. Also, not good to use for activities, as they easy to fall out. -Nice carry caseSONY MDR-EX300SL - 25£, Horrible, booming bass, distorted -Bass, Ok, booming, too much -Mid, horrible, distorted vocals -Highs, Bad, not present, no highs at all",0
"When you look at them, the design may appear to be uncomfortable given its odd shape, however, this shape causes the ear buds to more snuggly fit into your ears. They produce good, clear sound quality and have a decent length.Now, I am not good at taking care of my things, I tend to break things, a lot. All my previous earphones have broken within one-to-two months, especially since I buy the cheap, 5-to-10 pound ones, however, the pair of these I bought has lasted me now around a months and have no sign of wear-and-tear.The only problem I can think of with these is that the ear pads tend to be a little unsecured. This means that they will sometimes fall off when you do not have them in your ear, this is not a common occurance, but it does happen sometimes. This personally wasn't a problem because I usually find the ear pads in my pocket, and even when I did not, which was once, I simply used the excess ear pads the earphones came with.All-in-all, this is a superb pair of earphones, they are light-weight, sturdy, have god audio quality, and are overall some of the best I have ever had.Final Score: 5/5",1
"These are very, VERY good, and not just 'very good for the price. I'd say 'incredibly, impossibly good but I'm listening to them and this is reality...and I am fussy about sound quality (a multi-thousand pound home sound system, that's how fussy). Their noise isolation is excellent, too; so much so that on my next airplane trip, which is in a couple of weeks, my expensive Bose noise-cancelling earbuds are staying at home. These earbuds isolate as well as the Bose active cancellation system and the this brands sound BETTER than the Bose.These are so good, I just bought another set.",0
"This works very well, both in day light and at night. I bought this for a gift for my bothers birthday and he isn't very skilled when it comes to technology, and this was easy for him to install",1
"These are honestly the best earphones I've ever bought. They last for a really, really long time, and with heavy wear. I use them pretty much every day, at my computer, with my iPod, etc. They'll get yanked around, run through the washer, bunched in my pocket...But they'll still always work! I would say, on average, they last around 5-a months before they have to be replaced, which I think is pretty incredible considering how cheap they are.I'm not an audiophile, but I find the sound quality to be pretty good. The unique shape of the earbud makes it to where they sit perfectly in your ear. its really easy to swap out the buds if you want to clean them or replace them with a different size. By far the best budget earbuds out there",1
"These earbuds are very good and when used properly, i.e., fit *snugly* into the ears, have good-to-excellent bass response -- something I know a little about, as I've played bass guitar for months and I reflexively listen to the low end first whenever I hear a new song. On sound alone, I would give them a four-star rather than a five-star rating, as they are the slightest bit muddy in the mid-range compared to really good headphones. And I'm being picky, I know.However, what pushes my review to the five-star level is durability: I am extremely hard on earbuds, listening to my mp3 player while doing carpentry, gardening, hiking through brush, working in the kitchen, etc. and I cannot tell you how many times I've caught the cord on something and yanked the 'buds out of my ears or the jack out of its socket and yet I've had only one failed set of these earbuds after over a months(!) of daily use. I have stepped on one or the other of the buds at least three times, cracked the 'bud cases twice and after an application of super-glue, they worked as if nothing had ever happened. Alas, after all of this brutal treatment, the left 'bud stopped producing sound, so I finally had to pull my unopened, three-month-old backup set out of my sock drawer.Just lucky with the one pair of 'buds? I don't think so -- I have the same brand and model earbuds on my secondary mp3 player which I've used nearly as much under harsh conditions for over two months and they're still performing great. I'm a frugal (read 'cheap) and active guy who hates buying expensive earbuds, only to have to replace them within three to a months. (If it were illegal, I would have been convicted of bud-abuse months ago.)So here you have these this brand earbuds that are comfortable, affordable, sound good, and are very durable. What more could a person ask for in a set of earbuds for daily use?",1
"A great unit giving decent sound, but what i like best about it is the size, its small and easy to carry and perfect for outdoors",1
"Great speaker for the price! I love the bass on this speaker! May not be to loud but its not bad at all. I personally am satisfied with me purchase. I would definitely recommend this for someone who wants a good speaker without spending so much money",0
"I really didn't expect too much from these headphones seeing as they are so cheap but I was so, so wrong. These headphones are incredible. I have owned several pairs of headphones in the past (in ear and around the ear) and believe it or not, these sound so much better. Right after I opened the box I spent like two hours just scrolling through my ipod and listening to random songs with these headphones and then the Bose and these consistently sounded better",0
"To say I'm blown away is putting it mildly. Now, maybe this means I've just had rotten luck 'til now, but prior to this set, every budget pair of earbuds I've tried, (£10-15 range), has left me frustrated and sorely disappointed: I've gotten thin and tinny sound with no bass, or muddy sound with no trebble AND no bass... Often barely a step up from the free set on the airplane. I've spent 4 times the cost of these on a skullcandy pair that proved entirely unlistenable. I'd nearly abandoned hope of a worry-free set I could batter in my usual merciless way and still ENJOY listening to. And then, I gave it just one more try...Now, they don't exactly look expensive, and I'll never claim these sound just like my beloved Klipsch or Audiofly earbuds: anyone expecting that from six pound earbuds needs a quick reality check. BUT, I'm also not about to shove those Klipsch and Audiofly investments into a jacket pocket every time I'm racing out the door, (dropping them repeatedly), or leave them on during naps, or say, have them anywhere in view when my audiophile cat is in the mood to examine the wires with her teeth. What the this brand does is offer sound that's crisp and dynamic enough to be properly enjoyed, with a pretty comfortable design, and at a price so affordable -- and so far below anything remotely comparable -- that the cat can have her own set if she wants it.its just plain impressive",1
"Excellent",0

"Excellent quality, easy interface to use, top quality OBD scanner at a low price, will definitely recommend, have used on my van, easy and clear to follow, had a management light on and although part changed before I even purchased the vehicle light kept coming back, now cleared and has actually stayed off. Cheaper to buy this item than garage charges for clearing it, so do it yourself",1
"I chose this one because the user manual was clear and easy to read. Product is robust and of good quality. I have yet to try it out but I am very pleased so far.",1

"I got this as a Temu free gift. It works well and I'm very happy with it. My only issue with it is the battery life. It lasts about 2 to 3 days if you limit it to health applications and avoid using it for social media alerts, calls, music etc.",1
"love it, love it works fine",0
"Amazing product worth every cent",0
"The sound is great for me.What amaze me is that you can own pairs of decent sound dual drive earbuds with this price.Sure, these earbuds are really a good choice,absolutely crystal clear sound brings better performance than my original apple earpod.For the dual drive design,I have to say it brings great sound quality for different styles of music.For the middle and the treble part,it perform better than those cheap earbuds,you definitely can enjoy ultra clear audio with this decent earbuds;For the bass,have to say its ok and can cover my needs(I don't like some kinds of music which is noisy).Beside,the earbuds is well made.the metal shell combined with silicone earbuds can distinguish the earbuds from the cheap rough one.The rounded edges design looks beautiful,also fit with my ears very well.Have to say this earbuds is worth to buy,would like to recommend it.",0
"Why bother to write a review about this products? Because I did not experience any of the primary negatives:1. Poor quality sound: I did not find this to be true. The sound quality and volume varies according to the device they are plugged into due to variations in the impedance of the device.These are 16 ohm impedance earbuds designed for portable devices that do not have a lot of power. If under- or over-powered the quantity and quality of the sound will suffer. I plugged them into my laptop and listened via VLC: no issues; into my custom PC with Logitech 5-1 sound system: no issues; into my Moto: no issues; into my Fire HD and Fire 7: no issues. As far as my ear is able to tell, the advertised frequency response of 20-20kHz is as claimed.2. There was one review that said these buds did not work with a cellphone case. Apparently the reviewer does not realize that, on the black market, one can purchase special cases that will permit these buds to work.",1
"case that is designed for your phone so that it permits access to all of the ports and camera lenses.3. Poor quality: these appear to me to be of a better quality that the 3-pair for £10 earbuds that I have been using for the past a months so I anticipate they will last at least as long. But, I just bought these so I cannot say.4. Uncomfortable: this I really do not understand, especially 'after 5 minutes. These earbuds come with three earpieces: 1.3cm, 1.15cm, and 1.0cm by my measurements. I chose the earpieces that give me a firm enough fit that they do not fall out. Over the past hour or so, I have been wearing these and have no issues. I suppose if one employs the largest earpieces and jams them in as far as the tympanic membrane, they might prove uncomfortable.For me, these are great: good sound, good comfort, good price. Oh, and BTW, I am the Lithuanian.Ed",0
"These are some great little earbuds! Sound isolation is good and audio quality is better then expected for the low price. My music sounds very nice and I have absolutely no complaint about that. Jack is the 90-degree elbow variety, as opposed to the straight kind. Keep that in mind if you have a specific need for one type or the other. Comes with 3 different cap sizes that attach securely. I went back and forth a few times to get the right size and the caps are still tight. Nothing I hate more than losing the rubber cap on a perfectly good set of headphones! The only complaint I could have with these is that the cord is a little short. I am 5'11 and the cord barely reaches the mp3 player in my pants pocket. However, this makes for a nice little compact package when wrapped up so it is not that bad at all. I would recommend buying these all day long",0
"Just received the headphone. The used material is really good. Also the sound is very good. The bluetooth connection worked also quickly with the english guide. Untill so far very OK!",1
"This is an excellent review of many important topics of Astronomy. Some astronomy resources can be too elementary and suffer from lack of rigor, while some resources for astrophysics and cosmology can be poorly written (terrible explanations of topics) and very daunting. This Schaum’s Outline for Astronomy by Stacey Palen is well-written, with excellent and succinct explanations of sometimes difficult topics. Illustrations throughout the book support the concepts that are covered and the calculations are well-explained and accessible. Five stars. Definitely recommended for students of astronomy!",1
"I hooked this up to my wife's computer yesterday and almost sent it back DOA. I hit the power button on the back several times and it wouldn't turn on. I even checked to make sure there was power in the end of the plug that goes into the monitor. As I was fussing with it, my wife came over and hit some of the other buttons on the back such as brightness, contrast, etc. and it came to life! I find that strange & pretty much unacceptable. After it started showing the home screen and browsing a bit we didn't think the color was all that great. It had a too bright look to it. After messing with the brightness and contrast we have it looking better (let's say acceptable), but certainly not great or even very good. For a better inexpensive monitor I'd recommend checking out a comparable Spectre monitor. Not recommended for a number of reasons.",1
"Fantastic reading can't put it down!!",1
"This was a very good buy. A happy 3-year-old insisted on having his Christmas dinner from it. The cutlery was just the right size for him to manage.",0
"A good quality set of tools. The bamboo is solid and of very high quality with no flaws or splinters. The edges are crisp and well defined. Overall a very good set of wok tools.",0
"This is a very easy to use and accurate detector. You simply hold it against the wall and switch it on. At first, the screen shows a series of instructions on how to use the detector. You then select what you want to detect and slide the device from side to side. There is sound, a picture on the display, and the coloured ring changes colour when something is detected. You can then mark the position through the hole in the detector.",0
"None of these detectors are totally foolproof and do take a bit of getting used to as there is an art. They also work better on newer houses with regular thickness walls. In my experience, I use multiple passes at different heights of the wall to ensure that I have found what I am looking for. This one seems to cope as well as my other Bosch professional detector, but this has the added bonus of the easy-to-use display.",0
"I would have liked a case to have been included for protection when not in use, and the back of the detector is just hard plastic so it can mark the walls if you are heavy-handed, but as a detector, this does do the job very well.",0
"This is a very effective product suitable for the home user or semi-professional. Not much bigger than a mobile phone it is easy to use - just switch on and within a second or two the image is displayed on the screen. There are buttons for lamp brightness, image rotation, and photo capture and playback. The camera wand is permanently fixed to the unit and is semi-flexible such that you bend it into shape and it stays that way.",0
"Image quality is good enough for almost any use. It focuses down to a couple of centimetres and the light is bright enough to see things at a good distance. The image capture works well - I have included a couple of photos to show the detail - the unit stores up to 8 images locally or you can add a 4-32 meg SD card for more capacity or to transfer the photos off the unit. The screen is clear and bright enough but if you use it outdoors then you will struggle.",0
"There are a couple of attachments which include a 90-degree mirror and a magnet which is strong enough to pick up a fork so will manage a lost nut or key with no problems. These fit securely and easily and store in the included pouch.",0
"Overall, this is a well-designed and very handy device to have around the house, or in the toolbox.",0
"It took me about twenty minutes or so to put this together single-handedly. It would have taken a few minutes less but the instructions are in very small print and one of the bags of parts was mislabelled so caused a bit of confusion.",0
"The design is good, it stands firmly on the floor and there is no wobble. Plenty of space for stuff with deep shelves and the double rail.",0
"However, the double rail does cause a problem for me - as my shirts are all extra large or bigger, the lower rail is about six inches too high and means that the shirts do not hang straight. This rail can be removed but as it only goes in one place you are then left with a single rail wardrobe. Not a big problem but a bit annoying.",0
"Overall, though, this is a sturdy enough wardrobe with plenty of space.",0
"This cable addresses a very common problem in my house of broken charging leads due to poor strain relief design and general misuse.",0
"The cable looks good - the colour matches the body of popular phones. The design and build quality are also good - longer strain relief areas and reinforced connectors. The cable feels flexible but durable.",0
"In use, it works as fast as the stock Samsung cable for both charging and data transfer.",0
"So overall this cable looks good and performs well with the added bonus of extra durability so I can highly recommend it.",0
"The products contained inside the set are all of the normal high Baylis And Harding quality. They smell nice and work well on the body and there is certainly enough in here for a few weekends away. The bag looks nice, but obviously, at this price, it is made from leather-effect material and is probably not durable enough to use as an everyday bag.",0
"As a gift set it is okay as it stands, but the products inside are wrapped in scraps of white tissue and held in place with tatty corrugated cardboard, so you may consider rewrapping the contents to make it look a bit more special.",0
"Overall, though, this is indeed a nice gift set suitable for a few weekends away.",0
"The hardest thing about using this kit was getting the timing right. On our first attempt at a trial nail we didn't quite wait long enough to apply the top coat and the whole thing went wrong. But after this initial fail, we managed to get a brilliant look every time. Even for a novice, it is easy and the effect is very striking.",0
"I would have liked proper instructions - the only ones are written on the back of the box - but otherwise this is a very easy-to-use kit to get a very striking effect.",0
"Put simply, this is a 1-meter strip of covered LEDs with a sticky back and an integrated plug and control unit which allows you to select brightness and colour by using one of two buttons.",0
"It works very well. The light it provides is bright and there are a good range of vivid colours. You can trim the length if you so wish. The adhesive sticks to almost any surface and holds the lights firmly. The coating on the strip means that it is easily wipe-cleanable.",0
"I would have liked the cable to be longer and more flexible - you are limited in placement options and the white-coloured wire is quite visible due to its thickness.",0
"There are cheaper options, but in my experience, you do get what you pay for to a certain extent. The moulded cable and integrated power supply on this mean that it is more durable and safer than most of the cheaper options.",0
"Overall, then, I do like this strip. It does exactly as advertised but could do with a longer cable.",0
"The results from this cooker are nothing short of amazing. Plenty of videos and guides online will show you how to use it to cook the best steaks you have tasted. Easily and cleanly. We have done expensive steaks, cheap steaks, a roast joint of beef, belly pork, fruit compote, soups and much more. It's a brilliant way to cook stuff.",0
"To use it you seal your food in a plastic bag (we bought a vacuum sealer and bags for this but you can use freezer bags if you like) then set the temperature and time and leave it. The food cooks to the desired temperature and then stays there. So for steaks or roast, you choose exactly how you like it done and then forget about it. When it comes to serving, remove it from the bag and sear it in a pan or the oven and you are done.",0
"The only issue I have with this is that it will not connect to my WiFi. I have tried Android and iOS apps, restarting everything multiple times, but in the end, I gave up. It isn't really a big issue as setting time and temperature is easy enough from the device itself, and the app works without a connection, but it is still a flaw.",0
"However, overall this is a very effective device that cooks many foods to perfection with very little fuss. Recommended.",0
"This is a decent Lego kit. It took me just over four hours to complete it, although for half an hour I was also talking to Three customer services so you could maybe shave a bit of time off that.",0
"The instructions are clear and very easy to understand, and at no point did I get confused or put things in the wrong place. The parts come in eight bags, with each bag being opened when directed in the instructions. This means that it is easy enough to find the right bits - at least for the first assembly. I am a bit disappointed that Lego no longer includes chocolate box style inserts in the box to separate the pieces for storage. No pieces were missing, although I did have a few extras (see photos). A disassembly tool is included which works very well and saves your fingernails.",0
"The set includes a few action figures in case it is to be used for play, although it does feel a bit flimsy to be played with as a toy. The arms and fingers move and the missile launcher thingys open up and you can launch them with a flick of your finger. Despite having just the one wheel there is an innocuous brace behind that which allows it to stand unaided.",0
"Overall this is a good set, probably more for display than play. And if you take it apart then it will probably take longer to reassemble than initially due to the numbered bags.",0
"This product works well. You charge it up using a standard micro USB cable - which is included in the box - then switch it on and cycle between heat, heat and light, and heat, light, and sonic modes. Then you just gently move it around clean and lightly moisturised eyes to stimulate the blood flow and hopefully reduce bags and dark rings.",0
"It feels nice. Once you have the technique then it is a relaxing experience. Time will tell how effective it is, and this will vary per person, but using heat and vibration to stimulate blood flow to an area is a proven technique.",0
"These headphones are a bit more of a job to set up than most as they need an optical connection from the rear of the PS4 to the dongle to get the full surround. This also means that you will not get full surround unless the device you are connecting to has an optical output so if you are buying these for a PC then check carefully.",0
"The instructions are clear and easy to understand with screenshots of the relevant screens from the PS4 to help with the setup. All cables are included and are of very good quality, as is the build quality of the headphones themselves.",0
"In use, I found the sound to be good for gaming but not the best I have heard. The surround works very well depending upon the support from your game and adds a lot of atmosphere. In multiplayer shooters, it can give you an edge as you can sometimes hear an enemy long before you see them. There are lots of midrange and highs but I find the bass a bit lacking. The microphone is good.",0
"They are reasonably comfortable but the vinyl ear cups did mean I got a bit hot after a while.",0
"Overall, I like these phones. The audio quality could be better but the surround sound works very well. Just check that these are compatible if you are considering them for anything other than a PS4.",0
"This set of shampoo, conditioner, and spray has been very well received by my daughter. She has long, fine hair and loves the extra volume and shine that she gets when using the set. The bonus is that this all comes in a really substantial-sized gift set ready for Christmas.",0
"The idea of having a juicer and a zester in one is a good one. And this product does both things very well. The reamer fits well in your hand and is comfortable enough to use - although a little bit harder than a reamer with a built-in strainer and bowl. The zester is very efficient and does a great job of removing the zest. And the whole thing is dishwasher safe and fits neatly into any kitchen drawer. Recommended.",0
"My daughter loves this product. She has long, fine hair and regularly straightens it so it does get very dry and fly away. Recently she has been using pure coconut oil, but finds that this product smells better and leaves her hair a lot softer and with a nice shine. Highly recommended.",0
"I loved the rebooted adult Penguin books and have the whole set. For me, this book tries to do the same thing, but falls very short of the mark. It is very disjointed and the humour jumps around too much for there to be any flow to the 'story'. I won't be reading any of the others in the series.",0
"A nicely presented gift set, albeit in a very flimsy box, of a decent range of Dove products. The body wash smells nice and leaves the skin clean and soft. The body lotion complements the wash well and leaves the skin even softer. The deodorant is non-irritating on gentle skin. And the final part of the set is a reasonable quality bag to keep all the stuff in for traveling. Recommended.",0
"This is a very nice, very heavy-duty baking tray with air holes to help crisp up your food. It works very well - biscuits, pizza, and chips are all made more crispy by the holes allowing condensation to escape. The non-stick works too, cleaning by hand is a breeze. As a tip - because the pan is thicker than normal then I found it works best pre-heated otherwise it takes a long time to warm and start to cook the food.",0
"This is a high-quality stainless steel cocktail shaker with a very different brass and matte black finish. It comes with a strainer and a measuring cup. The body join has a silicone seal and fits together firmly whilst the lid just presses on, similar to other shakers. There is an integral coarse strainer under the lid for large ice cubes and so on. The finish looks to be durable as long as the hand-wash-only instructions are followed.",0
"Overall this is a very nice looking and well-performing set.",0
"The pins on this gauge are a lot finer than my previous (plastic) contour gauge, which means that it has a lot higher resolution. This allows for a very accurate copy of your template item. However, the pins on mine are very stiff, needing a considerable amount of force to be moved. While this does ensure that the design is retained, it does mean that it takes a lot of force against the object to be copied to get the pins to move, so much so that it left an imprint on my plaster coving. It may wear in over time, and I have added some oil to help it along, but for now, it only gets three stars.",0
"I am a big fan of bits and pieces of useless information, so for years, I have enjoyed books full of the stuff. This book is therefore currently at the top of my reading list when I have a few minutes to sit down with not much else to entertain me. Each page has a selection of short anecdotes, facts, or stories related to food. Most of them are one or two sentences long, and almost all of them are eyebrow-raisers.",0
"Reading it in one go is not recommended as fact overload sets in very quickly, but to pick up and put down a couple of times a day, this is a great book.",0
"This cable is slightly thicker than the stock USB cable included with my Galaxy S8 and is therefore slightly less flexible. It also follows the current trend of having non-existent strain relief so will need to be treated with care. However, on the upside, it is a lot longer than my stock cable and performs as well as the stock cable. And all backed up by the Belkin name.",0
"Recommended.",0
"This is a smart-looking and very effective device that has allowed me to connect my Samsung Galaxy S8 to my TV via HDMI. I simply plugged in the HDMI cable and attached it to my phone to mirror the display almost instantly. There is very little lag which allows me to show photos, videos, games, and more. The cable is about 10 cm long and reasonably flexible, and the whole thing rolls up into a space not much larger than a USB stick, which allows me to carry one device to and from work instead of a selection of USB sticks.",0
"Be aware that this will not work on every USB-C device - my Galaxy A5 wasn't compatible - but otherwise I highly recommend it.",0
"This pole doesn’t do the job very well. It is made of aluminium so feels very solid and durable but is quite a bit heavier than plastic poles. Although this does mean that it is a lot more stable and potentially will take more abuse. When extended it feels equally solid, and the camera is controllable with a good amount of precision. The extension part of the pole is satin black to minimise glare. The remote is held firmly in position and is in the right place for finger or thumb operation, although it is a bit rotated from the camera when the pole is locked at its full extent, but you do get used to this. I’m very happy with it.",1
"A nice looking large-sized pan which has a handy clear lid and silicone non-slip handles. The pan heats up quickly and evenly on my induction hob and is oven and dishwasher safe. The pan feels a bit on the thin and tinny side, but the base is thick and does the whole thing works very well. It is also backed up by a five-year guarantee. Recommended.",0
"This is an excellent cleaner with very powerful suction and highly effective filtration, which means that there is no doggy smell from the carpets when cleaning up after pets. It is made from very high-quality components that feel like they will last for years. The design is good too - the unit is compact and relatively light so it follows you around with minimum effort, relieving pressure on your arms and wrists compared to an upright. Suction is amazing - at full power it sticks to the carpet and is quite hard to move around - but there is a pressure relief valve on the handle to release anything you inadvertently suck up like a rug without switching off the power.",0
"It comes with a good selection of tools - in addition to a bristle brush, extension nozzle, and mini head, you also get a long flexible nozzle for under furniture or behind car seats and a hard floor head for ensuring very effective cleaning of vinyl or laminates. The cable is long enough to do almost the whole floor of a house without changing sockets and retracts smoothly with the press of a foot.",0
"It does have the downside of requiring replacement bags which will cost money, but as I said before, this is balanced by the more effective filtration and smell removal over bagless cleaners. And the lack of a rotating brush does mean that dog hairs take a few passes to remove. But overall this is a very powerful and effective cleaner.",0
"This is a very well-designed and built cleaner that has high-quality durable components.",0
"It has been a while since I used a cleaner with a bag as opposed to bagless and I was pleasantly surprised. The suction is very good. So much so that it can be hard to move it across the carpet on full power. There is also less of a smell than when using bagless cleaners - we have two dogs and I currently live in an old house where the previous occupants had six dogs - and the smell from a bagless can be quite overpowering after a few minutes. The filtration seems to be a lot better at removing said canine odours. Cleaning performance is good but the lack of a rotating brush does mean that dog hairs take a few passes to remove.",0
"It comes with a good selection of attachments - a small brush, a crevice nozzle, and a mini head for furniture or car seats. All of these bits store securely at the base of the pipe. The pipe itself is thick and durable - unlike our latest bagless - and long enough to almost do a full flight of stairs. There is a pressure relief valve on the handle to release sucked up rugs without having to switch off the power. The cable retracts with the press of a foot and there is a place to store the handle with the cleaner upright so it does not take up too much space. The rotating casters mean that the base unit follows easily around the house so overall there is a lot less stress on your wrists than when using an upright.",0
"Overall, this is a very good cleaner. Quality and performance are good and the components are durable. It is quite expensive and will require replacement bags, but the balance is that in my opinion, the filtration is better than with a bagless.",0
"A very handy-sized container which has proper hinges instead of bending plastic and rubber seals so that it will keep the damp from your ingredients. It is freezer, microwave, and dishwasher safe. There is really nothing to fault with this container. I will be buying more.",0
"Overall, this is a good product. The chain is quite thick but relatively light. It is protected (and your paint is protected from the chain) by a thick fabric. The five-digit combination is easy to set to your own numbers and clicks easily into place. There is enough space between the dials to make setting the number easy. The chain is just long enough to go through your bike and frame and still attach to a close pole or railing.",0
"The only downside is that the plastic of the lock part itself is very sharp, so careful placement on your bike is required so that this doesn’t damage your paint.",0
"It is quite a simple idea - just photos of dogs catching treats (with a one-page introduction and a few pages showing the names of the dogs) but everyone who has looked at this book loves it.",0
"It isn’t particularly long, and you can leaf through it in a few minutes, but it is still good nonetheless. Certainly worth flipping through every now and again when you have a few minutes or need cheering up.",0
"The clear instructions meant that this headset was easy to set up on my PS4. Build quality is very good, with strong-feeling hinges and springy bits. The design is also very good - they are comfortable and everything is well laid out with controls easy to find and the microphone folding away well when not in use. Prolonged use didn’t lead to pressure sores or overheating of my ears. Audio quality is excellent - deep bass and crisp highs, with little leakage so you can play at volume without annoying others in the room. When you select the superhuman mode it really does highlight significant sounds such as footsteps or reloading - a bit of an unfair advantage some would say. I found the connection reliable and stable, and the battery life to be long enough for a full day of gaming. It also works with my gaming PC running Windows 10 which is a very nice bonus.",0
"This is a very nice watch with a great colour scheme - nice matte grey with a striking pink accent and hands. It is quite light, the strap is flexible and it has a large enough range of adjustment to cover every wrist. The hands are easy to read in any light. Recommended.",0
"This is a very stylish compact soap dispenser and steel soap bar set which should look good in any kitchen, backed up by the quality of Joseph Joseph.",0
"The soap dispenser fills easily by removing the pump and takes a whole bottle of your favourite hand wash (I like strawberry laces). Pressing the pump gives a suitable measure of soap, and any drips are caught on the plastic tray beneath. I don’t know how the steel bar removes the smells of garlic and onions but it does. The whole thing is very neat and effective.",0
"You do need to look after the stainless steel, as residue from the soap can stain it, but otherwise this is a nice looking set which should last for years and save buying a whole new hand wash pump every time you refill.",0
"The pattern on my curtain doesn’t match the picture, although the colours are the same. The curtain is made from a woven fabric rather than a plastic sheet, so the curtain looks a lot better and hangs a lot better than other plastic sheet shower curtains. It is also machine washable so should last a lot longer than the plastic sheet curtains. Attachment is via buttonhole type holes in the top, and I was a bit disappointed to see that there are no rings included to fix this to the pole.",0
"This advent calendar is a good replacement for the cheap cardboard ones we usually get for the kids. It looks pretty both when it is lit and when it is unlit. The scene is suitably festive yet not too gaudy and makes a nice centrepiece for the season.",0
"The downsides are that it is made of very thin laser-cut plywood. It certainly isn’t very durable. The drawers are on the small side, so if you are expecting to have a treat for every member of the family then you will need to find some very small treats.",0
"Overall though, this is a nice advent calendar that looks good and does the job, even though it is a bit flimsy and the drawers are on the small side.",0
"This product comes in a very attractive, but somewhat oversized gift box. Several members of my family have tried this set for a couple of weeks, following the instructions to the letter, and each one of them has reported that the results were average. Skin did feel clean and soft, but no more so than when they used their regular products. So overall it is a nice set, but the results were average.",0
"There is very little to fault with this set. It comes with two masks and two sets of earplugs in a carrying case. The mask is made of silk which is very soft and comfortable and effectively covers my eyes and blocks out light. The earplugs are of a memory foam type and do a good job of blocking out sound.",0
"All in all, this is a good set.",0
"My daughter I saw always on a time me to not use soap to wash my face, and I have a beard so this seemed like a good product to use for the job.",0
"The dispenser gives me enough for washing my face and beard with one pump, and the product feels rich and has a nice cedarwood smell. It produces a decent amount of foam, but not too much, and doesn’t sting if you get it in your eyes. After use, my skin feels clean and soft, as does my beard. If I am going to shave then the bristles are softer and shaving causes less irritation. I haven’t tried it on my hair as it seems to be a bit expensive to use as shampoo.",0
"I now use this every two or three days, as washing every day causes my beard to go a bit flyaway.",0
"From the Dead Sea Scrolls to Harry Potter, this book covers a good selection of some of the most significant books written so far. It tells the story of writing and creating the books with lots of great illustrations and photos. If you are interested in books, want to get your children into books, or just like coffee table books which you can dip in and out of, then this is an excellent book.",0
"Sugru is a very versatile handy thing to have around any house. You open up one of the little packs and mound it into whatever shape you require and after a number of hours it sets into a firm rubber. I have used it to repair broken plastic and rubber handles, to improve or fix strain relief bits on cables, add non-slip things to slippy surfaces, make hooks to hold cables, and many other things. There are literally hundreds of uses for this around the house, garage, and car. I always keep some in the fridge (it has an expiry date and apparently lasts longer if you keep it cold).",0
"We use this as a doorstop, but it is very well made and comfortable in the hands with a rubber base to protect the floor.",1
"The LED is quite hard to see, but otherwise this is a good charger that works well with my Galaxy S8+ through a case.",1
"The case fits the phone snugly and the cover snaps closed firmly to protect the screen from drops without adding too much thickness. The cover also holds open with the magnetic catch. Ports are easily accessible with the cover open or closed, and the recess actually makes finding the fingerprint scanner easier. The feel is a lot less slippery than the original phone. Overall I'm very happy with this case.",1
"This is a cable that feels durable and comes with an included velcro-type cable tidy. You will see from the photos (the Bqeel has the cable tidy visible on the right) that performance is equal to the stock Samsung cable and allows for my Galaxy S8+ to fast charge. Recommended.",1
"These bulbs are very compact but produce a good amount of crisp white light. They do get a little warm around the base, but no more so than other brands of LED bulbs. Recommended.",1
"A very comfortable and reasonably lightweight set of ear defenders which do a very good job of filtering out noise whilst still allowing a reasonable amount of voice through so you can hear someone talking loudly.",1
"On the face of it, this is a strip of slightly bendy metal with a bit of padding. However, the whole is so much more than the sum of the parts.",1
"I bought this after watching a couple of teardown channels on YouTube as I like fixing my own stuff when I can. Previously I used a screwdriver, kitchen knife, or anything else I could find lying around. This often caused damage to the casing being opened. With my new spudger, I can open almost any plastic casing more easily and without causing anywhere near the damage I caused before. It bends where it needs to and is stiff where appropriate. The soft parts prevent it from digging into your hands and there are different angles for various casings.",1
"It comes attached to a card which shows how to open various common Apple products, but I would suggest having a search to find out the best techniques.",1
"This set of lights does add a bit of ambiance to any TV. They stick well and are long enough to fit around the back of my 49-inch TV. The remote works well even with the sensor behind the telly and allows a good selection of colors. If the lights were a bit brighter then the set would get five stars.",1
"The pull out map could have been made of higher quality paper - I doubt it would even last a day - and the information is time limited, so expect to buy a current version every few years. But otherwise this is a very useful and informative guide for the traveller to get the best out of a visit to the capital.",0
"I have been doing DIY for 20 plus years without one of these, and now that I have it I wondered how I managed without!",1
"This square is very well made and easy to use. The markings are clear and easy to read, and the material it is made from is very sturdy.",1
"A slight moan is that the distances are all in inches, but it is degrees which is important here and they are universal.",0
"This grinds pot is low enough to sit under the basket of your espresso machine when not in use. It is made of good quality materials and performs exactly as advertised. The rubberised bar prevents damage to the basket whilst the non-stick interior means that it is easy to clean. I would have liked the bar to be removable for deep cleaning, but otherwise this is just the job.",1
"This product does exactly what it promises. The display is clear and it seems to be accurate and responsive.",1
"Considering the size of this speaker, about the size of an apple, the sound quality is good. Very good high and mid range, with an acceptable bass which can be improved a little depending which surface you place the speaker on. It is loud enough to fill a bedroom or for background in an office, but would struggle outdoors.",0
"The instructions are in picture format, but reasonably easy to understand. The device is easy to use, with voice prompts and flashing LEDs. A play / pause / answer phone button is on the front of the speaker along with volume up and down. The microphone works well for hands free calling. At five hours the battery life is almost good enough to last a whole day. It pairs very quickly and reliably with my Samsung phone.",1
"I now have this permanently on my desk as the sound quality is head and shoulders above that from the speaker on my phone. If it was water or splash proof then it would get five stars, but for what I am using it then it does the job very well.",0
"We use these tablets on our whites at a standard 40 degree wash. Cleaning power is good, but some stubborn stains such as grass or dried in food will need pre-treatment with a stain removing stick. The Febreeze smell is subtle and gets swamped by the fabric softener. Otherwise these are a good performing general washing tablet for all laundry.",1
"I have been washing my coloured work clothes with these tablets at 40 degrees for a year or so and have definitely noticed that the colour remains for longer than with standard bio tablets. Stain removal is generally good on standard coloured cotton cycle, although for some oily food stains I have had to pre-treat with a stain remover bar. Recommended.",0
"This aerial does let me watch digital TV 15 miles exactly from the transmitter, and works through a stone wall. However inside is not fixed very well, so every time my subwoofer puts out a bassy note the aerial buzzes quite loudly. I have tried damping with rubber, but the noise is there all the time. If I move the aerial well away from the telly it stops, but then I have cable trailing across the room.",1
"This is another high quality low price item from the Amazon Basics range. A set of three suitcases which should be large enough for most family holidays.",0
"Each case has the same extending handle, durable wheels and handy pockets and pouches in the liner. The opening is via zips which are again of a good quality. There is a further zip to give you a couple more inches of space should you come home with more than you left. The plastic material feels durable yet is quite light considering the size of these cases. And they all stack into each other for storage. The handles are a good length and the wheels allow for pulling across a smooth surface - either upright on all four or tilted on two. There are also carrying handles on the top and side and feet opposite to allow the cases to sit upright in different orientation.",0
"My only slight reservation is that the feet seem a bit exposed, and I am not totally convinced that they would stand up to repeated airline baggage stresses. Time will tell and I will update if required.",0
"This wok is a little bit smaller than my usual wok, but it still has room enough for a three or four person stir-fry. It heats up very well on my induction hob, and the non-stick means that it is a breeze to use and even more of a breeze to clean. Nothing sticks to it, even sticky sauce can be wiped off after use. The handles are riveted firmly and the coating is incredibly hard wearing - we have had a frying pan covered in the same ceramic non stick for a few years now and it is still as good as new.",0
"Fits in all of our car seats and effectively protects the upholstery from wet and muddy dogs. The dogs don't mind sitting on it and certainly prefer it to being in the boot. The only negative side is that the webbing is fairly cheap and is starting to slightly fray around the edges, but otherwise this is a very good product for the price.",1
"The bits are hard to get out of the in-handle holder but otherwise this is a very good general purpose screwdriver to have in the kitchen drawer or tool belt. The shaft is removable to make it into a bit of a stubby screwdriver for those hard to reach places.",1
"Love it. I now have two of these and one Echo Dot spread around the house. The whole family now use them for music, controlling our Phillips Hue lights, calendar, trivia, converting measurements, timers, schedules, reminders, news... The list goes on and on. Sound quality is good too.",1
"A genuine pack of coils which produce a good amount of vapour with no after taste. Each one lasts me a couple of weeks of fairly decent use.",1
"This pan is quite a bit smaller than I expected but as it turns out perfect for several reasons. Firstly it is ideal for cooking one egg, or making a bun sized filler like a burger or similar. Secondly because it is small, durable and very easy to clean it is going in my walking kit to pair up with my gas stove for my outdoor cooking. It heats up evenly and is durable and very easy to clean as well as being not too heavy.",0
"These tablets do a good job of cleaning and are suited for those with sensitive skin as the amount of harsh chemicals is limited. I found that stubborn stains needed a warmer than 30 degree wash, and the most stubborn grease on cotton stains needed pre-treatment with a stain stick. We recommend these for delicate fabrics as well as delicate skin.",0
"A very concise guide to building regulations in England and Wales. Well laid out with clear explanations and illustrations and a thorough contents and index. If the regulation isn't in here then the book normally gives a clear indication of where to go to find it.",0
"A really good lightweight (ish) cook set which fits well on to my gas stove. Durable and easy to keep clean. The mugs are just the right size and insulated to keep your drink warm when outdoors.",1
"A good strong stainless buckle for paracord projects. Very well machined these will hold a huge amount of weight. Took a week or so to arrive from China but worth the wait.",1
"These do the job. Cut and melt the ends of the paracord and it will screw right in and hold very firmly. The metal is very thick and allows you to work the cord through awkward materials such as leather (make holes first).",1
"We love this fire pit. The metal is thick enough so that the pit keeps its shape well, and once it heats up it stays hot for a good amount of time. The pit is large enough in diameter and height to accommodate a decent fire. It looks really good when the fire is burning. The handles are very sturdy when you need to carry it around, and the supplied rod for removing the cover is likewise very strong and durable. We are very happy with this.",1
"Very good quality and very long cable. Charges iPhone and iPad at the same speed as the stock cables. The bright woven finish is durable and makes the cable easy to find.",1
"These slats were perfect for repairing a broken bed. They are a little bit thicker than the ones already on the (budget) bed but fit perfectly.",1
"Mine arrived missing the feet. As it was too difficult to return due to my location I made some out of stuff I had lying around the shed. In use the rail produces a good amount of heat and dries the towels effectively.",1
"A good bright light and lasts for a good few hours on the lower setting. The plastic is thick and the fasteners hold everything at the required angle.",1
"I'm a big fan of Stanley products. This one does the job well and keeps my beer cold and fizzy at barbecues and outdoor events. The only thing that does annoy me a bit is that the lid stays at about forty five degrees when open so does get in your face a bit when you are drinking. But otherwise this is a great product and certainly a talking point.",1
"Very simple white embossed wax melt warmer. Simple to set up literally straight out of the box and plug in. Added bonus is that there is an on/off switch on the cable so no need to constantly keep plugging in or out. I liked that this is smaller than some of the Yankee Candle versions as it takes up less room. Heated up wax melt very quickly and gave off strong throw. It says not to keep this unit on for more than 2-3 hours and I did make sure to turn it off then as although the dish is well made, its my opinion that its not quite as thick as some of the yankee versions and wouldn't want it to overheat. Otherwise excellent and the price makes this very attractive.",1
"Update: 01/11/17.....this burner is so good I have just bought a 2nd one",1
"This is a very nice bronzing compact. Unfortunately mine was a broken compact on the outside of the box as was cracked but the powder inside is intact and is totally gorgeous. A beautiful gentle bronzer with a little golden sheen or sparkle, I have very pale skin and was a little unsure of how this would work for me in the compact as looked quite dark. But when it goes on its perfect......I really do like the healthy natural glow this bronzer allows and I would recommend to anyone that wants just a warm gentle colour. I would expect this to last a long time as a little goes a long way!", 0
"A small wind chime, perfect for hanging in my bedroom at the window and catches the breeze beautifully with a very gentle tinkling light sound....I love it!! The Rose quartz is excellently pretty and I love that the wood at the top of the chimes has also been painted pink to match. Very pretty!",1
"The quality of St Eval candles is top notch, this is an extremely large candle, a real statement maker and one to place on the coffee table with pride. The candle fragrance on cold (unlit) is strong and can be noticed around the room and when lit gives a fantastic throw in the room and other rooms beyond, as the fragrance throws well. I love St Eval as they are a soy candle which means that they burn easily and well....a few hours lit and this candle pools beautifully and will last a long time. Cant recommend this company enough, they are truly excellent quality.",1
"Nice quality candle! Deep orangey red candle wrapped in thick paper to protect until used. I placed on a candle plate, removed paper, the fragrance is incredible from the candle, its a really sherbetty zesty cranberry with a backdrop of the gingery tone as the under fragrance.. which is great for the Autumn/Winter time. The candle was easy to light and burnt lovely, taking the wax pool quite away across the candle itself. You should aim to burn these candles for 2-3 hours at a time this way you avoid the 'tunnelling' of the candle when you have a small pool in the centre of the candle that doesn't expand across ....... this will shorten the life of your candle rendering it difficult to light later on. If you burn 2-3 hours then your candle has enough time to burn across which then makes the burn even and you get the most out of your candle. If you burn for longer then you risk the mishap of your candle by bulging the wax out of the initial candle shape. When burning this candle has a really good throw and can be smelt in other rooms around the house from it. Quality is second to none with this brand and I would recommend them and this candle in a heartbeat!",1
"Having not used this brand for a while I was happy to give this product a go. Nice little compact of colour, no applicator but the compact is full of of the product so I think we can forgive that as long as you have a brush or applicator to use with this. You get alot of product for the money I think. The eye colour is Slate that I am trying and its supposed to be a 'nude' type colour, which in the palette it did not look at all, it looked darker but when applied it is very delicate in colour and muted and works well for everyday use. The eyeshadow is very soft to apply and gives good coverage without a huge amount being used, it lasted well on my eyes which I use a primer on first. I would recommend this product and would also recommend the colour to anyone looking for a soft gentle 'nude' type of day wear look. Top marks for this very affordable little compact.",0
"I enjoyed this book, its a cosy drama that is very inoffensive, fun and gently washes over you. I do have to confess to enjoying a lighter read especially at bedtimes, I struggle with sleep at the moment so I always look for a book to read at bedtime to help lull me and this kind of light reading (yes I know its a murder story) is just the ticket! I was drawn in very quickly and I enjoyed the story fold out. Its a nice read and would recommend to anyone who enjoys a cosy village drama, like Agatha Raisin. Agatha Christie this is definitely not, but why should it be its a genre of its own",0
"Neat little compact palette which will fit nicely in a make up bag or even your purse/handbag. Very clearly labelled as to each colour to do each separate thing on the front of the palette. Dark circles, redness and 'dull'. I think the redness was the best of the three, however I can't really get excited on how well they did to be honest as I didn't really feel they did anything more amazing than other products that I have been using.....however, on my daughters younger skin they did seem to be more efficient so its got a high rating from us!",0
"Nicely boxed gifts of deodorant and shower wash. Good packaging so will be nice as a little gift and smells fresh and zingy. Easy to use and did a lovely job for a fresh shower. Deodorant fresh and works well!",0
"This is a large item so you will firstly need a good of storage space/area for it or a fair amount of space in a cupboard for it. Its an impressive piece of kit with a detailed instruction booklet which we found easy to read and set machine up with. Its pretty straight forward feed the fruit/veg into the tube and go, it works very quickly and literally eats through the fruit in next to no time, which is quicker than the booklet says to leave machine on for! The juice comes through a spout and into the jug which is provided (you have to place under the spout). We had apple juice in no time and its excellent stuff. I was uneasy as to the going for a juicer for a while, but really glad I did. The downside for me was the sheer size of it and having to clean it.....but thats always going to the case when using a machine like this, quite fiddly to clean up! All in all this machine is really excellent, I have not used a juicer before so cannot compare of older or alternative models but I would not hesitate in recommending this item!",0
"Wow at last I have found the ideal treat!!!! My dogs are super fussy Yorkshire Terriers and a Shih Tzu and we have tried many treats of different kinds, but they are so hard to please with most traditional doggie biscuits being hidden under the sofa once they are given out as they just don't want to know. I have tried alot of different brands and some are ok but frankly its such a limited choice for a good quality non-rawhide treat which has a good flavour and appeals to my dogs......I saw these and took a chance as the price was reduced which made a huge difference to my deciding to purchase as the rrp at the full price is a little bit more than we would normally afford. Glad we went for it, they absolutely loved them and went down a treat, no sickness or bringing treat back up, just lapped up and enjoyed and kept them busy for several minutes actually (they are small dogs) which was an added bonus. They look genuinely good for them and I am happy to treat these on their daily afternoon snack. We would recommend them for trying out and hope that the price stays at a sensible level.",1
"Huge box of lego!!! The theme is popular as its very current Ninjago. Inside the box are the instructions which are complex to put all this together, I would say that this is best to assemble at the older end of the range as its quite complicated and detailed, and alot of patience is required to put it together, it may be good for a younger child to build with an adult and would give that 'bonding' time alot of use!! We had fun doing this and it took us a good few hours but was worth it, my son is at the older age range for this but he is a lego maniac and he got on with the job.....once together it really looks super and is very detailed there are lots of the mini ninjago figures 7 in total and little tools with it too which will give alot of time for play once assembled, the 'drawbridge' shoots out which will go to enhance the imaginative play along with rocks and dynamite sticks too and we also liked the 'guardians' figures which are very exciting...... this makes a lovely playset!! My son will be displaying his along with the other lego marvels that he owns! Truly brilliant kit this is though and would make an excellent gift to a lego/lego ninjago fan!",0
"This has an extremely elegant and expensive look to it....the scent is something that I think is a little bit too strong for me personally but then again I am quite sensitive to strong scents so for me it was a little too overpowering and made me feel slightly nauseous. My friends and family all commented on how lovely it was and how expensive it looks. It does have a very luxurious look about it, so if you are not overly sensitive to strong scents you will probably really like this!",0
"I have tried a lot of different brands for their lightbulbs as I have one of those high ceiling chandeliers which needs several bulbs. This one was cheap and was exactly what I was looking for. It is bright and works well. It fits perfectly into the chandelier and is easily replaceable. It did come well packaged to prevent it being damaged.",0
"Incredible pillow! I have a habit of over-packing my pillows (I like them full) but this one is perfect. The pillow does not lose its shape, does not go flat, and stays comfy throughout the night. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a great pillow. The quality is fantastic and the price is really good for what you get.",1
"This is a very small book, smaller than I anticipated, but the content is interesting. I think it's a good little book for a quick read, but don't expect a lot of depth. The information is well organized and easy to follow, and it does provide some useful tips. Just not as comprehensive as I would have liked.",0
"I bought this for my niece who is very crafty and loves making things. She has been really happy with it and it has kept her entertained for hours. The quality of the materials is very good, and it's easy to use. I would recommend it for any child who enjoys crafting or is looking for a fun and creative gift.",1

"This wall clock is stylish and easy to read. The quality is good, but the ticking sound is quite loud, which can be distracting if you’re sensitive to noise. It’s a minor issue, but worth noting.",0
"The facial cleanser is gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The texture is nice and it doesn’t dry out my skin. It’s a good product, but the scent is a bit strong for my taste.",1
"The travel bag is spacious and well-organized. It’s perfect for short trips and the material feels durable. My only issue is that the zippers can be a bit stiff and hard to open sometimes.",0
"This wireless charger works well and charges my phone quickly. The design is sleek and it’s easy to use. My only complaint is that it gets quite warm during charging, but it doesn’t seem to affect performance.",1
"The plant pot is sturdy and looks great. The drainage holes are a nice feature and it’s easy to clean. The only downside is that it’s a bit heavier than I expected, which might be an issue for larger plants.",1
"The umbrella is a decent size and does its job in keeping the rain off. However, the construction feels a bit flimsy and it doesn’t seem very durable. It’s a good option for occasional use, but not for heavy rain.",0
"This puzzle is challenging and fun to complete. The pieces fit together well and the image is clear.",1
"Decent for the price, can't complain. Only thing was that it was difficult fitting the small earbuds on.",0
"This feels so luxurious. It really does a good job of exfoliating and giving a deep clean. I'm planning to use this at least 2-3 times a week. In addition, it smells great but not really like coconut and lime.",1
"It does work. A little bit is needed. Would suggest using in moderation as it is harsh. Only leave on for a few seconds then increase time with use, to allow your skin to get used to it.",1
"This is my go-to, everyday cleanser. A little really does go a long way. It has helped in controlling my acne and oily skin. After using, my skin feels soft and refreshed.",1
"Not thick enough for me unfortunately. It absorbs quickly but it doesn't retain moisture for long.",0
"I have tried other brands of jojoba oil and will have to say this is the best one I've tried. I can tell it's been distilled to the highest level due to the pale color of the oil. It feels great on the skin and absorbs very easily without feeling overly oily. Will definitely purchase again.",1
"It's quite liquid which came as a surprise. The smell is strong, although pleasant. It didn't really do much for me, so I ended up giving it away.",0
"Too thick for my hair and the smell isn't great.",0
"Can really feel the pulsating. It cleans out my pores so much since I have oily, acne-prone skin. I can really see and feel the difference with this clay. It lasts absolutely ages in such a large tub.",1
"Use for my oily skin and it has helped keep the oils at bay, so it is now my moisturizer. I also use it with other carrier oils for hair treatment. Love it.",1
"I'd heard so much and had high expectations. It clings to my concealer and is hard to blend out the powder. I wouldn't purchase unless they had a compact powder. I just find the whole process of using it messy.",0
"I absolutely love this. It's amazing. It fully polishes my skin and my skin feels soft in the morning when I wake up.",1
"I use this to wash my fabrics and makeup brushes. Leaves everything squeaky clean but gives a very strong and tingly sensation.",1
"This is a wet clay mask which is packed with lovely, natural ingredients such as shea butter. You can really feel it working as time progresses and the mask tightens on the skin. After wiping off, it leaves your face feeling really soft and detoxified. The tub is also large and will last you for ages!",1
"Great quality for the price and smells lush.",1
"Does everything it claims to do. My skin feels soft and fresh and looks more alive after use. This is great and it is a mask that can be used daily as an option. Only slight thing I don't like was that I felt a tingly burning sensation after application, which subsides as the mask is left on the face.",0
"This product is definitely value for money. Using this weekly really helps to give your feet that extra TLC. And as it is a large tub, it will last you a very long time.",1
"I guess you get what you pay for. It is good to use but can't hold onto big coats and can be quite flimsy.",0
"I love it; it's very pretty and flat.",1
"The only criticism is that you can't stand your iPad up on it. It keeps sliding off.",0
"It's quite big and doesn’t exactly fit into my ears, but it sounds good.",1
"I have really enjoyed all the Shopaholic series, but this was not as exciting. It did drag on a bit, and it took me ages to read it. It only got better towards the end. Still a good read.",1
"Good book, but I find the crafts quite fiddly.",0
"This is a nice solid case, but unfortunately it has no hole for the camera. Disappointing.",0
"This bag looks gorgeous. Great purchase.",1
"I bought this after reading some good reviews, but I must admit the quality is pretty poor. But I guess for the price, I shouldn't expect more.",0
"Really unexciting read.",0
"Absolutely fabulous read. Very exciting from beginning to the end, although I was a little bit disappointed with the whole Nick back-and-forth dramas. Can't wait for the next one.",1
"Very good quality charger. This charger is sturdy, and I've been using it for a few weeks now with no problems. I will definitely recommend it.",1
"Very nice earphones. Not very noise-reducing but still effective. Quick postage and excellent communication.",0
"I have absolutely loved all of Angela's adventures, and this is no exception. It's laugh-out-loud funny at times and just completely bonkers but completely unputdownable.",1
"It was a little bit humorous but very disappointing. Not usual Julia Kent standard. I was expecting it to be a follow-up to Random Acts of Trust, but it was different and so boring!!!!",0
"The book was quite easy to read and gave good explanations. Would recommend it; best environmental management book I’ve read.",1
"The glue seems to be working well, although I am new at sugar craft. Also, very good value for money.",1
"Very stylish, great sound, does its job. I'm not an expert on headphones, so can't give any more technical reviews.",1
"This would be quite funny in a film. Nothing romantic about it, especially with all the disasters occurring, but it's readable and I might even read the others.",1
"Another fantastic writing from Diane Chamberlain. Especially this tugs at your heartstrings. No mum should have to give up their child. Love the book, loved the ending.",1
"Nice read, romantic enough but could have been much better. It just seems the characters could have been more developed.",0
"Like all Diane Chamberlain books, I couldn't put it down once I started. Brilliant read. I had to restrain myself from reading all her books all at once.",1
"Incredibly boring; I could only read a couple of stories. Nothing passionate about it, just same things, different scenarios. No thanks.",0
"I love Bruno Mars anyway, so I had to get his new album, especially as I'm going to his concert. I loved Doo Wops and Hooligans, and I love this one as well. Maybe not as much, but that could be because I haven't been listening to it for long.",0
"Different styles of music with that amazing voice. And he kind of sings love songs but in a very sexy way. Love it!!!!",1
"This was my 5-year-old son's first scooter, and as he's quite big for his age, I had to get one that would support his weight but not be too advanced for his age. This scooter is perfect for him: sturdy and an easy ride. Also perfect to take on holidays as it folds away. All in all, happy with this.",1
"Great quality hat. Feels amazing and looks good. Glad I got it. Quite a good size too. Would recommend it.",1
"These shoes were bought for my nephews. They look amazing and fit well on their feet. They feel true to size.",1
"Rubbish!! Rubbish!! Rubbish!!! I'm absolutely disappointed with this rubbish product. I complained about the first one that I bought; they sent another one to me. Still does not work. I don't know why Amazon should let people like this sell on their website. It's annoying because it's another stress on its own trying to send it back. I don't write reviews, but this is the first I have ever written. I really don't want to give it any star, because there's no point giving any star to a product that I paid for and never used it for once.",0
"My earlier review was a mistake. It was meant for Tao Tronics Bluetooth headphones that I bought.",0
"These are absolutely phenomenal!!!! Filling and extremely tasty! If you like Wotsits, you will love these :)",1
"In love! For the price and how satisfying these are. Better than buying or eating a chocolate bar.",1
"I read this book in two days, and I also have a very busy lifestyle. Let me tell you, you won't be able to put this book down!! This is amazing, Toke! And there are so many lessons to be learned in this book!!!",1
"Not very happy as the seal had obviously been open before, so I'm guessing this is a returned product. For the price I paid, that's definitely not acceptable. I'm just hoping it's the real stuff in there. Fingers crossed.",0
"These run out so quickly.",0
"Very loud, bass-y, and clear sound for such a tiny little thing. Definitely good enough for a large-size room.",1
"This thickens up well, but you would definitely need to use a blender.",0
"These are actually pretty good and have some good bass, and I listen to Afrobeats and rap songs :)",1
"Really lovely and yummy, although the coffee isn't strong.",1
"This is an excellent quality of grape seed oil, and you can tell it's genuine. I really can't wait to purchase their other oils.",1
"So at first, it felt like I rubbed sunflower oil on my body, and I could tell this wasn't going to be the best. But I decided to give it another try, and I can definitely say the viscosity and quality of the oil should be better. But then it is a low price. So I bought another grape seed oil that was £2 more for a liter, and it's soooo much better than this one. I guess if you don't mind too much about quality and viscosity, then it's an ok standard oil but barely has the usual qualities of grape seed oil. So now it's abandoned on my windowsill and just waiting for a use for it lol.",1
"Amazing for thick Afro hair (leave in overnight or a couple of hours).",0
"These were so good, yum!",1
"These are so good; I love them and they are quite reusable.",1
"I think it works, as I haven't been to the gym too crazy and my butt is already changing.",1
"Really moisturizing; could act as a lip balm.",1
"It does what it says... It doesn’t provide slip or moisture; it just detangles, softens, and smooths your hair.",1
"Such a beautiful blush for dark-skinned women and very pigmented.",1
"This is so good and easy to get your fiber in or soften stool. I just mix it well with my water, and it blends in clear and tasteless.",1
"These are great and aren't too ridiculously sweet, and they are addictive.",1
"If you have naturally curly, frizzy lashes, this is your savior!!",1
"Waited a while, but it came as described, and the smell is pungent, meaning it's good quality.",1
"Leaves a sticky residue.",0
"Really pretty on dark-skinned girls.",1
"A bit tight to fit your earphones in the splitter; it takes some force, but good quality.",1
"Bought these for my mum, and she loves them as the aftertaste is fine because usually with green tea, the aftertaste can be bitter.",1
"Helps a lot with PMS!! This is definitely a good quality of wild yam, as you feel the effects ASAP.",1
"Makes my skin softer, and the bottle pump is so useful and makes application easier. This is the best quality I have tried on Amazon so far; I just wish they did bigger bottles.",1
"For shades NW45/NW43/NC50 or Estée Lauder Nutmeg. This finishing powder is AMAZING!!!! So happy I bought it!!",1
"Quite yum but can taste a lot of whey protein",1
"I weigh 17st and am also very bottom heavy... This makes the bikes at the gym much more comfortable.",1
"Smaller than expected.",0
"I guess this is a Marmite kind of thing; you either love it or hate it. My mother isn't a fan as she loves classic white soft bread. As for me, I absolutely love it. It's so addictive and perfect for a nut and seeds lover like me. Yes, it's not anything like fake bread that you get in the shop obviously...but to me, it's absolutely delicious and quite filling. I'd usually have 4 slices of bread, but just one slice halved into 2 is filling enough for me.",1
"My mum really likes them.",1
"Yummy, big, and filling.",1
"Only one coconut/baby wipes and way too many barf/peach.",0
"Very dark and applies well.",1
"Gives you a white cast if you're ethnic.",0
"Doesn't last long.",0
"Decent fit.",1
"Really good shampoo.",0
"This stuff is heavenly addictive. It doesn’t have many ingredients and has a good protein count.... I'm gonna try and see if I can get a bigger container.",1
"Quite black but definitely not waterproof.",0
"Best mix I have ever had and is addictive!",1
"I love this stuff and use it on everything!! It turns ordinary soup into delicious bowls of goodness.",1
"Lasts forever and helps with my period and took away my dry eczema skin.",1
"Be gentle because it can cause tongue bleeding.",0
"Really nice and simple and doesn't look like a safe.",1
"Really good blotting paper.",1
"Nice but dries out quickly.",0
"Quality and speed of it decreases after some time, still decent though.",0
"Does the job well, but I wouldn't recommend douching as I ended up with BV.",0
"Really nice for your feet and to add to bath water.",1
"I can only really use the trimmer; not sure how to use the shaver yet.",0
"Exactly like the original.",1
"After a few weeks, quality will start to decrease.",0
"It's a really pretty color on dark-skinned women.",1
"Good for co-washing Afro hair and is a decent leave-in too.",1
"Really good, even if your hair is like Tumblr weed.",1
"More gold than pink on the skin, so much better as a highlight for dark-skinned girls; it's absolutely beautiful on dark skin.",1
"Helped with my periods and made my bust a bit fuller and might have added more definition to my hips (not sure if that's down to the gym), but it does increase appetite. And I only take 2 a day; sometimes I forgot to take any, and it was still fine.",1
"Just have to adjust a bit to fit right.",1
"Wouldn't say 24 hours, but it is if you put glycerin/coconut oil/Palmer's on top.",1
"Had compliments on my skin while using this.",1
"The fit for this is okay; just got to play around with it and see. Makes your boobs look bigger and plump and has nice cleavage and thick back strap, which is good for back fat and back support... durable too.",1
"Doesn't really work; best going to a gyno.",0
"This is quite potent, as can be told from the smell, and makes my skin soft and smooth when used overnight.",1
"I'm falling in love with Card-io stamps after seeing them being demonstrated properly. They are very small, and repetition is the key. Stamp a few of the bottles onto the card, then take 2/3 different, complimentary ink colours for the leaves and stamp multiple images, inking the stamp then stamping three times before re-inking to get different intensities of colour. Leave some areas with just the lighter images and stamp the hops into these areas. It's so easy to create a fantastic card with just a few stamps and three/four ink pads.",1
"Each set of Card-io stamps has a stamping guide on the insert sheet, giving recommended ink colours and initial stamping ideas, which is a very handy feature!",1
"Highly recommended: use in conjunction with the Card-io Majestix acrylic rods: Acrylic Rod - 25mm. For use with Cardio Majestix Mini Stamps",1
“Perfect music to blast out in the car on a summer road trip.”,1
"Brilliant designs from Tim Holtz as always, but the production method left a little to be desired.",0
"There are six different but complementary hexagonal patterns (just like you'd see on a Moroccan carpet/rug). You get each design on a larger and a smaller stamp. The larger hexagons are approx. 4cm and the smaller versions are 2.5cm when measured between parallel sides.There are also five border stamps, three of which give you a tassled rug edge and two of which are more general - one with a stylised flower/diamond pattern and the other has a dashed line/sawtooth pattern. These are all 15.5cm long, varying in depth from 4mm to 1.8cm.The red rubber gives the most incredible detail - I used them with Versafine Vintage Sepia ink on kraft card and the result was brilliant - add a couple of brightly-coloured bits and pieces for a great effect.That's the good stuff - and it's really *good* good stuff. The disappointment comes with the final production.They are on a single sheet of red rubber with a grey, cling surface on the reverse.The stamp pattern is printed on the reverse of the stamp. They also went to the trouble of cutting the stamps for you, so that you can pull them out and replace them back into the sheet for storage. Perhaps I got a bad batch, but this should have been caught by quality control:The reverse print of the stamp does not line up with the actual stamp.The die they used to cut out the stamps does not line up with the stamps. All the hexagonal stamps are off-centre, making the stamp and the reverse print both off-centre but in different directions. In two cases, the die had cut part of the actual stamp detail away.These dies are clearly designed to tessellate and so allow you to create a full carpet on your card; this means you need to get twenty or thirty individual images lined up correctly, one-by-one. With the off-centre cutting of the die, and the incorrect positioning of the pattern on the grey backing, it is very difficult to get the stamps to print where you want them to. It is even more of a problem if you are combining different stamps to build up your pattern, switching between stamps as you go. You end up with some shapes overlapping and large gaps between others. The only real solution will be to cut out the stamps again by hand, then try to ignore the print on the reverse when positioning the stamps.",0
"These sheets cut first time with the outline dies I have. Cut the same outlines in cardstock and stick onto the magnet, then cut the detail die in a contrasting colour and stick that on topUse a non-stick craft sheet over one of those dry wipe/magnet boards and the glue will dry with the magnet perfectly flat.For best results, I then use Pebeo glazing resin (gives a nice, smooth, dome finish) or Ranger Glossy Accents (adds a clear, solid top layer that follows the contours of the detail die)If you want to store dies - these sheets aren't thick enough on their own. The same company sells a thicker version (0.85mm) which works much better for die storage.",0
"These dies cut paper, card etc. very well. The only problem is how the flip you assemble the finished decorations? Yes, there are basic instructions given, and ""slot two pieces together"", is pretty straightforward. But how do you slot that last piece into place? The star and the ball fall into this category. The decoration you make using the long, curvy strips can be finished, but it is not clear the order in which you should stick the ends of the strips into place, as the width of the strip at the ""bottom"" end (where you first glue the strips together) is just a little too wide and distorts the natural curve of the strips you glue in place last. Trial and error, I guess!",1
"Why, Spellbinders? I have bought a number of your die sets where there is an outline die and any number of detail dies that fit perfectly on the outline. Essential for making things like fridge magnets. I saw this set had the emoji detail dies and a solitary, plain circle die, so I couldn't resist it. So, Spellbinders, why is the plain circle die smaller than the detail dies? Had you forgotten about flexibility with this die set? Now I have to find a circle die that cuts precisely 0.75'' diameter circles in addition to buying this set. Even if the plain circle is to create your own emoji using the 'bits and pieces' die, why would it be 0.05'' smaller in diameter than the others?",1
"Yankee Candle's pure essence range is my absolute favorite for crisp, clear, and focused fragrances. This Wild Mint is simply perfect - reminds me of when I used to pick the mint when it was lamb for the Sunday roast. As usual, the wax tarts give the best 'throw'. I have a large jar of the Wild Mint and you get more of a hint of mint.",1
"Great purchase these cost a lot more in the shops , They are better value than the cheapest I have found at the local chemists and have bought 4 packs and will no doubt be buying more.",1
"Took quite a while to arrive, but they are very good—just what I wanted as I have loads of rechargeable AA batteries, and these will be handy for the items that need D-size batteries.",1
"This light is exactly what I needed. It was bought not as a security light, but to light my way from my garage to my back door. It was very easy to put up; took my son about 5 minutes. I have added a picture taken in daylight and another at night. I would recommend this light. I have also bought the MB360 for over my front door. I am well pleased with these lights.",1
"This light is exactly what I needed. It was bought not as a security light, but to light up my front door so I could see the keyhole. I was always fumbling in the dark. This light is perfect. I have set it pointed down towards the door, as I have a very short path to the pavement and did not want it going off every time someone walks past the gate. It was very easy to put up; took my son about 5 minutes. I have added a picture taken in daylight and another at night. I would recommend this light. I have also bought the MB390 for my garden. I am well pleased with these lights.",1
"I got myself a Tasimo machine recently and have tried a few different drinks, but this is definitely my favorite. I add a little extra hot water and some coffee creamer, and I have the perfect cup of coffee to wake me up every morning.",0
"I bought these to help strengthen my nails and hair. Can't say I have seen any difference yet, but happy with the price and delivery.",1
"Delivered quickly; they are what they are—strong mailing bags.",1
"I have taken cod liver oil for many years to help with arthritis in my knees. This brand is always a good price and always delivered quickly.",1
"Very lightweight, easy to maneuver in-between furniture. As it's quite small, it gets into gaps and right under the bed. Good suction and easy to empty, although fluff can get stuck at the top next to the filter. Bit fiddly to connect the hose as it's located right at the bottom of the hoover, but otherwise, I am pleased with it. Makes hoovering less of a chore and doesn't strain my back. The pile on my carpets has never looked so good. The suction power and lightness of the vac make cleaning fun! Thanks for a great product.",1
"I recommend this product.",1
"I have only been using it for a few days. It is very simple to install and set up.",0
"This camera produces clear high-quality video and comes complete with mounting fittings, USB lead, extra sticky pads, plus the instruction book. I have been looking to replace my last dashcam which was stolen from my car and have been reviewing dashcams for a while before deciding on this model. The deciding factor for me was that it was the only camera on Amazon that had a five-star rating. If you are looking for a good camera at a reasonable price, then look no further; this is it. The functions on the camera are easy to use, and the picture quality is brilliant. It comes with instructions which are easy to follow if you're buying one for the first time. I am extremely pleased with my purchase, and I am very happy to recommend this camera to anyone looking for one for their car. It is very good quality at a very reasonable price.",0
"I bought 2 of these, unfortunately, they are both duds; they just stayed on all the time—they did not go off after 20 seconds. I tested them in a completely darkened room, outside on my patio at night, and in my garage. Each time, I would leave them for anywhere between 10/30 minutes, and the lights never went off. They even came on and stayed on in my living room, which is brightly lit. I bought Duracell batteries to use them, so I know the batteries were good. They are sold as Auraglow, but the ones I received had no branding on the lights, instructions, or packaging—they appear to be generic Chinese copies. I am in the process of trying to return them for a refund—not so straightforward when you buy from a marketplace seller, unfortunately.",0
"Exactly what I wanted to use with my Tassimo coffee machine. These are quite heavy, sturdy mugs which are perfect for my needs. Nice for my morning coffee and for a good big mug of tea throughout the day. I expect these will last a long time as they are very well made. I took a while choosing which glass mugs to buy, and I am so glad I got these. Delivery was fast, and the mugs were very well packed.",1
"I am a great believer in vitamin supplements, and I am very satisfied with this one. Fast delivery and great value for a 1-year supply.",1
"The fit is perfect, but I have to say I am very surprised at the very poor quality compared to previous ones of the same brand. I certainly will not be buying these again.",1
"A really good knee brace was a great help to me when I had a problem with my knee. It is nice to know I have it there for future use.",1
"Traditionally used for supporting physical and mental well-being, I can safely say personally it helped me cope with daily life stresses. One must take ginseng for a minimum of 1 month to observe any differences, so do allow enough time.",1
"Highly recommended.",1
"I am very pleased with these Vitamin D-3. They are quite small and therefore easy to swallow, and provide a good maintenance dose for anyone whose Vitamin D levels can be a bit on the low side.",1
"I am sorry but I have to leave a star, but this is a waste of money in my opinion as it did nothing to brighten my hair. I do not recommend this and will not buy again.",1
"Very pretty earrings. I bought these to go with the matching necklace as a gift; the recipient was very happy with them. I have bought other items from the Heritage range in the past and have not been disappointed.",1
"Nice foundation; it goes on smoothly and lasts all day. I use other Max Factor foundations as I find they suit my skin and are very good value.",1
"I am sorry but I have to leave a star, but this is a waste of money in my opinion as it did nothing to brighten my hair. I do not recommend this and will not buy again.",1
"What can I say—the grandchildren love their Nerf guns. We have quite a selection of these. My 6-year-old granddaughter loves this particular gun; it is the one she will always pick out of the box of Nerfs. It is definitely her favorite.",1
"I have been using this brand for several years now, and for some reason, the last few times I have used this exact color, it does not lighten my hair the way it used to. Instead of dark blond, my hair is more medium brown. I will not be buying this again.",1
"Lovely quality; the fit is true to size. It is a very warm jacket with nice deep zipped pockets—just what I wanted. But the hood is not adjustable as advertised, which is a bit of a bugbear for me, so I have only given it 3 stars for misleading advertising.",1
"Delivered very quickly.",1
"I gave this to my 11-year-old son. He worked it out and could fly it in 20 minutes and is currently playing with it a lot. Here is his review: This drone is great for indoor fun and is very entertaining. The controls take a bit of getting used to, but after a while, it works really well. It's slightly smaller than the image on the box portrays but it’s very durable and lightweight. The controls are a similar size and are decently responsive. The charging system requires a normal USB and is slightly strange, as sometimes it will stay lit up when it’s fully charged and sometimes it won’t. It’s also very loud. All in all, this is quite a good product that will entertain most people for a while.",0
"This is a beautifully presented watch in a lovely case, complete with a small screwdriver and a choice of watch straps. It has a satisfyingly heavy feel and clean look outside the face. The face itself is a bit crowded but looks OK. I'm now hunting around for some decent instructions on changing the time/date and changing the strap. None come with the watch, which seems an error. A shame as the rest of the presentation is so good.",0
"Sturdy construction, quick to heat, and easy to clean, these pans seem excellent value. Scrambled eggs and bolognese cooked quickly and cleaned easily. Obviously, I don't know how they will last, but so far, so good.",
"An engaging meander through the life of a very lucky member of the French aristocracy just before the revolution, detailing his friendships, loves, and accidental social climbing. The somewhat gentle pace at the beginning picks up towards the end as events around the hero and his family start to collapse. Versailles and life at court are well depicted as is the French and Corsican countrysides. My only criticism would be that the hero sometimes floated through life a little, somehow remaining untouched by the events he was engaged in, more interested in his food. This may well be a reflection of his status as a French aristo though!",0
"I'm normally a bit wary of short story collections as I find the stories end before you get properly engaged with them, so I approached this with caution. However, I was really pleased to discover that in this collection, set in the fantastical world of the Hispanic Isles, the stories featured the same characters at different points in their lives and built into a single arc, featuring pirates, Norsemen, musketeers, and mages, chasing treasure, redemption, or peace. The stories were lively and well-written with pace and drama. The setting I found particularly strong and I'd happily read more about this world by this author. Write more!",1
"I've sometimes pondered the wisdom of attending a school reunion and wondered how much it would cost to hire a helicopter. Like most geeky, uncool kids, I'd like to return to tower over the bullies and wonder what I ever saw in my old crushes. In Reunited, Gothard explores this territory with a light, fresh, slightly unpredictable touch which means you are never sure what is going to happen and you want to find out. The characters are believable in their uncertainty and the ending is very satisfying without being cliched. I enjoyed it, although I wished it could have been a bit longer.",1
"The Survivors' Book of Secrets is a fantastic book that inspired me to build defensive, efficient bases to fend off my enemies in Minecraft. It features helpful tips and diagrams so you can really understand what to create, as well as useful battle tactics to leave you triumphant. Thankfully, it provides the different threat levels of each enemy, so if you haven’t encountered every single creature in Minecraft, then this is the book for you! It also tells you the most effective ways to defeat your foes, so if you’re going to take a powerful enemy on, you know exactly what you’re doing. Overall, it’s a great book and if you were considering buying it, then you definitely should!",0
"Trying to do any kind of resistance workout whilst traveling is a pain. Most hotels skimp on the weights and trying to find a gym for three days is not worth it. This band is light and easy to tuck in a suitcase and tremendously versatile when it comes to exercise. It has held up well so far as well.",0
"Playmobil, like Lego, is at the quality end of the toy spectrum. A sturdy hospital helicopter, with a few fiddly bits but strong enough to take some robust play. A bit of force was required to put it together but once it was done we had a good quality, non-violent toy that will last for ages.",0
"This basically squirts a blast of water/mouthwash between your teeth. It seems to be working but can be messy and you can end up spraying it all over the bathroom. However, it seems easier than floss and a sight less bloody. Probably worth persisting with.",0
"I reviewed the preceding volume in this series from Daniel Polansky and said it was a little slow as it set the scene for the storm to arrive. Thankfully, this second (and final?) volume fulfills the earlier promise and is a rich and satisfying conclusion to the story. The characters continue to be satisfyingly complex and morally ambivalent. The action is pacy and the plot strong. The world he has created is very fully realized. Highly recommend alongside Those Above.",0
"Clear, simple recipes for gluten-free food, that cover a variety of different palates and tastes. I've cooked a couple of these now and had no problems. I shall be cooking more!",
"Every time I read a Paul Kearney book, I wonder why he isn’t a more well-known author. He is simply brilliant. This is a wonderfully dark, rich, fairy tale full of earthy goodness, forbidding woods, and mysterious figures. Beginning on a farm in Ireland of the fifties, the real and fantasy worlds are equally well imagined, the characters are well painted, and the plot is satisfying. Highly recommended.",0
"I've been going to the gym a lot more recently and getting into weights. I'm a bit skeptical of supplements both as to their safety and as to the difference they actually make. However, these did work and had no ill effects. They did improve my performance in the gym. The only downside was having to take 5 in a day.",0
"Two of Swords the series is a great read with strong characters, shifting perceptions of the truth, intrigue, and plenty of drama. It is recommended. However, it is starting to meander somewhat as yet another character embarks on another long journey and I'm hoping for a resolution soon. Otherwise, it is going to feel like a bit of a rip-off, which would be a shame as I am a big KJ Parker fan.",1
"I think I've written before in reviews of historical fiction about the tricky balance between historical detail and narrative excitement. Authors seem to fall one way or the other with only the very best, Bernard Cornwell or George McDonald Fraser seeming to get the right blend. This book leans towards the narrative drama rather than the historical fact, especially at the beginning where some of the modern language jars. It struggles to find the right tone until it gets to the Crimea where it gets reasonably good at painting a picture of the period and conveying the action at the same time. The central character is interesting and looks like he is going to get even more interesting, although the requirement for his motives to be purer than his actions is not required. I'll end with a note to the publisher. You will have lost readers for this book by putting the wrong uniforms on the front cover. It won’t matter to some but history enthusiasts can tell the difference between Peninsular War uniforms and Crimean War. And we will judge you for it.",0
"A nice smelling shave gel that is OK. It certainly feels cool on the skin and doesn’t cause irritation. When it is on, the shave is smooth. However, not being able to see it on your face is vaguely irritating and it doesn’t seem to stay on long. I was having to reapply halfway through the shave.",0
"I was a bit skeptical when I first took this out of the box. There seemed to be a lot of padding and not much space. Also, the handles didn’t seem to be the strongest. However, once I started to load it up I was very pleasantly surprised. It seemed to take an awful lot of stuff, including a laptop, securing it safely and neatly. The handles have held up very well, after several weeks of dragging it back and forth. Altogether a very good manbag.",0
"Hand cream and lip salve that really works for both your enlightened, metrosexual side and your inner testosterone-fueled caveman. A good gift for the significant other in your life, whatever their gender.",0
"This is a very powerful and reasonably compact fan that certainly works well. If the weather actually got hot enough to need it, it would be great. The one caveat is that it is quite noisy, so you may not want it in a small office.",0
"Sometimes personal shredders can be a bit rubbish, jamming all the time and slicing documents into thin strips rather than actually shredding them. The REX1323 doesn't have these problems, it shreds properly into tiny pieces and doesn’t struggle with multiple sheets. It also does CDs and credit cards although I haven’t tested them yet. Just be aware it is quite large so make sure you have space under your desk!",0
"This is an odd tale of one family from the Edwardian era through World War I into an uncertain future. Despite all the horrors of war and disease which are dealt with in detail, there is still a lightness and whimsicality to the novel and this doesn’t quite work. It’s not a bad read but it’s not a great novel either.",0
"First and foremost this is a deeply moving, but never sentimental story of one man and the owl he reared from a chick. It is written with a restrained, wry 'Englishness' that conveys the powerful bond between man and owl as they move live first in a London high-rise flat and then in the Sussex countryside. As the story unfolds you get a real sense of a time and place, primarily Seventies Britain, that no longer exists",0
“Writing from detailed diary entries (some of which are quoted) the author goes into detail about Mumble's behaviour. His careful observations are delivered with clarity and humour, and demonstrate formidable knowledge as well as his background in history publishing (with comparisons to military aircraft proving particularly insightful). He breaks the story and the careful observations with succinct and useful chapters on various aspects of owls, in our culture, in their natural habitat etc”,0
“In summary, highly recommended as a heartfelt but restrained celebration of the life of Mumble the owl, an education about these fascinating creatures, and a compelling evocation of a time before iPhones and the internet.”,1
“The Quarry books are always a pleasure. Expect a mildly un-PC, fast-moving thriller with plenty of action, well-drawn characters, and a satisfyingly cynical and laconic narrator. Required reading when you want a piece of quality escapism.”,1
“Graham Hancock's War God is a fictional retelling of the first part of Cortés's assault on the Mexica (Aztec) empire in 1519. The writing is fast-paced, gritty, and professional, and the story rattles along, criss-crossing between different characters as they gradually draw closer together.The setting (as you'd imagine) is bloody, with human sacrifice and slaughter ever-present, which makes it difficult to warm to some of them, particularly at first. As historical fiction, it is effective. Initially, I was less happy about the mystical element to the story (basically, there are some gods floating about), particularly because some of their interventions seemed to be there as plot contrivances rather than as an integral part of the story. However, I was less bothered as time went on, and the afterword explained it a bit better.”,0
“I've read all three of these shorts about Dr. Watson by Patrick Mercer, and they are very good. They evoke the period well, with a particular (as you'd expect) feel for the military background of Watson and his earthy sidekick Bowler, but also have a modern rawer feel, which is no bad thing. The mysteries are good, the recurring villain (no spoilers) is compelling, and they are quite funny in places. I'll definitely pick up the next one.”,1
“I had a large collection of these as a kid, and now my sons do too. They love them. Definitely the best quality plastic soldiers around, with great attention to historical detail, and they look fantastic laid out on the carpet. The only problem is that some of the gun tips break off in combat, but that is to be expected.”,
“A surprisingly interesting look at the science of forecasting and how it applies to everything from baseball to terror attacks. Cogently argued and well-written, this book made me think a lot about how the world around us is presented by media, government, and pressure groups. It is a relief to read something that reflects the uncertainty of the world that we live in, arguing that we should reflect this uncertainty and beware of those who don't. An excellent book with only one tiny downside: it is rooted in the American experience, in baseball, and the US economy, some of which I had to work to follow, although this is offset by the author's clear explanatory style. Recommended.”,0
“This is a hard book to review without giving anything away. Suffice it to say it is much better than Gone Girl—tense, exciting, and gritty (not entirely for the faint-hearted). A book you don't want to put down until it is done, and once it is, you wish it wasn't. Highly recommended.”,
“I'm not really a board game player, but I took this on a camping holiday with my two boys (bright 9 and 6). We played it every night after tea and loved it, so much so that a couple of other kids joined in as well. It took them a little while to grasp the cooperative aspects of it, and there was still an element of competition in wanting to get the treasures, but we very quickly got most of the rules and started playing. A couple of rules were not entirely clear, but they became apparent as we went along. I would thoroughly recommend it as a wonderful alternative to TV, iPods, and computers as a way of sitting together and having a lot of fun. You'd be surprised how tense it all gets when the waters start to rise, bits of the island start to disappear, and you are racing for the helicopter pad!”,1
“My partner is a long-term fan and wrote the following: A fantastic CD. An intimate portrait by those who knew her most that is both compelling and revealing. It continues to support why Nina Simone is still revered as both a great singer and legend. Fighting prejudice and standing strong, this is a wonderful tribute and definitely worth a listen for anyone who would like to know more about an incredible woman with an incredible voice. I was named after her and am glad to be.”,0
“Always nice to have a break from the plethora of Napoleonic and Roman adventures in historical fiction, and this is an excellent alternative. The Major's Traitor is the latest in the series from Conway, but there has been a bit of a break between this one and the one before. No matter, as you quickly get a sense of time and place, and the characters are well-drawn and engaging. In many ways, some of the supporting characters are more engaging than the hero, who, like many heroes, seems to have the ability to be right a lot of the time. The best-written parts of this book are the battles, where the author's army.”,1
“No need to worry if working with a small stamp and a big ink pad, as the surface of the stamping plate never touches the card, unlike getting ink on the edges of a standard stamping block. Another great use is to be able to rotate the card to add the same stamp to the four corners—push the card into the corner of the frame, line the stamp up with the corner, then press the plate onto the stamp—it will always stamp at the same position in that corner. So stamp—rotate the card 90 degrees—stamp again and repeat. You can build up perfect geometric patterns in this way. So many uses! Can't wait to really try it out.”,0
“We can make this file beautiful and searchable if this error is corrected: It looks like row 992 should actually have 2 columns, instead of 15 in line 991.”,
“Review of double-disc Blu-ray set. Saw the original at Drury Lane once—not that impressed. Saw the 2014 production, as seen here, and saw it again and again—such an improvement in terms of pace, staging, you name it! Day seats meant that I was on the front row of the stalls numerous times for just £20—brilliant! And now we have the film of the show. I saw it at the cinema. For some reason, the volume was so low that you could hear the subwoofers from the action movies on other screens, not to mention the munching of popcorn and slurping of drinks, so I'm looking forward to watching this movie on my terms! OK—it's a brilliant record of a brilliant show. The cinematography is superb. The only fault I can find is that the editing room floor must have been littered with the footage filmed from the static cameras that must have been there on the night of the 25th Anniversary Performance. Cameras that must have filmed the stage as a whole. One of the reasons I loved this production was that the stage was used to its full extent. You could look left and right and see other stuff. “Dressing the stage”, I believe. When Alistair Brammer is giving his truly stupendous rendition of “Why God Why”, stage left, there is a wonderfully understated bar scene stage right.”,1
“I tried this out on an Excel novice, and they found it a very useful introduction to the basics. As someone who uses Excel a lot, I thought I knew it quite well, but I also found this book useful in demonstrating functions of which I was not properly aware and as a refresher on things I had forgotten. Well worth a read.”,0
“This book is part of a wider writer's project that can be found here - [...]. It is a great concept with some interesting ideas, particularly in seeking to restore the reputation of the Western fighting orders in comparison to the Eastern ones and to suggest the former's fighting tradition was at least as illustrious as the Samurai. The book contains an interesting array of characters on all sides of the conflict and there are some interesting hints of what is to come, but unfortunately, as a stand-alone piece, it doesn't really work. Very little happens, and the book doesn't have a very satisfying story arc. Maybe that comes in future titles or through the online writing, but I'm not sure there was enough here to make me want to seek it out—we’ll see...”,0
“Having reached the end of the wonderful Mr. Gum books by Andy Stanton, I was looking for something else to try on my two sons. We gave this a go, but none of us were gripped. It just seemed to be trying too hard to be funny.”
“A very brightly colored, well-laid-out, and simple-to-follow detox/'youthing' guide, with the focus on de-aging yourself rather than pitching a diet plan or kick-starting a weight loss program, though in effect it's the same thing. An interesting twist. What man or woman wouldn't be interested in knocking off 5 years in this looks-conscious world by eating beetroot? There are concise 'science' bits on the best and worst foods to eat, the reasons why, and how you can most easily add them to your daily life.”,0
“There are some good overviews in the opening chapters: the main reasons why we age—poor digestion, hormonal imbalance, inflammation—and advice on how to reduce their effects through a better diet. It does hammer home the 'youth' mantra, so if you are at all paranoid about getting older, this book will not make you feel any better about it. Focus on the health benefits; otherwise, you may never leave the house again!”,0
“The 2-week detox is hard-core, but for a genuine kick-start it can work. The first week is mostly green smoothies and juices, with some other very healthy food. The second week is a combination of the same and other whole foods. The suggested meal plans are practical, but it can be quite hard to follow in reality, particularly if you're not used to such a healthy diet. But the end results are good. If you stick to it, you will feel the benefit. (Some people will probably find the whole thing a little bit much, particularly if you are used to the highly processed food that we all often live off.) The book is well laid out and easy to follow, and most of the recipes are nice.”,1
“I live in Oxford and spend a lot of time in the Cotswolds and this was not particularly helpful. My impression was not helped by a couple of bits that were a bit out of date and overall there was nothing here to lift it beyond any other guide book on the area”,0
“This is a thinly veiled account of mobsters from the thirties into the sixties where there is a lot of fun to be had in working out who the characters are based on, Frank Sinatra being the easiest. Although a slow starter it does finally get going and the story is entertaining enough, in a Mario Puzo style. It is forced to tie things up neatly with a Hollywood ending which is a shame as an Ellroyesque trilogy would have been interesting”,
“Several years ago I remember watching Mike Loades on TV with an excellent series about various weapons in which he used insights based on practical usage of weapons to explain military history in a different way. These insights are invaluable in understanding better how battles were fought and won. In this book he has gone even deeper, taking a number of swords from different periods of history and looking at them in depth, at their manufacture, design and use. He brings practical experience in wielding these weapons plus tremendous knowledge and enthusiasm. Blended together they make a tremendous book for anyone interested in history as well as swords and swordsmen”,0
“Taking on the writing of James Bond is pretty tough. 10 minutes with the originals and you can see why they were so good. Even so, to miss by so much is unforgiveable. The worst thing about Carte Blanche? It is just a bit dull. Fleming never needed a big plot twist at the end to build excitement. Don't bother”,1
“Recent photographs from the area show the real impact of atrocities and this book presents a snapshot of some of the brutal events seen in that part of Africa. It’s shocking and devastating, but a necessary read for those interested in the subject”,1
“My nine-year-old son has just discovered this book and reads it over and over. I found it slightly less interesting and a little too straightforward. But my son loves it and that’s what matters”,0
“I have been reading and collecting the classic gothic novels for years and this book really stands out from the rest. The story is chilling, the atmosphere is perfect, and the characters are well-developed. It’s a must-read for fans of gothic horror”,0
“As someone who enjoys both science fiction and classic literature, I was excited to read this book. It combines elements of both genres and delivers a captivating story. The characters are well-developed and the plot is engaging, though some parts can be a bit slow”,0
“This book is a brilliant example of modern fantasy. The world-building is top-notch, and the characters are both relatable and intriguing. While the plot can be a bit predictable at times, it’s still a highly enjoyable read that I’d recommend to fans of the genre”,0
“The art in this book is fantastic and really brings the story to life. However, the narrative itself is a bit lacking in substance. It’s a beautiful book to look at, but it doesn’t quite deliver in terms of storytelling”,0
“I found this book to be a bit underwhelming. The premise is intriguing, but the execution falls flat. The characters are one-dimensional and the plot feels repetitive. It’s not terrible, but it didn’t leave much of an impression”,0
“This collection of short stories is a delight. Each story is unique and offers a different perspective on the human experience. The writing is strong, and the stories are both thought-provoking and entertaining”,0
“A comprehensive guide to modern gardening techniques that is both informative and practical. The book is filled with useful tips and advice, though some sections may be more relevant to experienced gardeners than beginners”,0
“This historical novel offers a fresh perspective on a well-trodden period. The characters are well-developed and the historical details are meticulously researched. It’s a compelling read that brings the past to life”,0
“I enjoyed the first half of this book, but found the second half to be a bit of a letdown. The story loses momentum and the ending feels rushed. It’s not a bad book, but it doesn’t quite live up to its potential”,0
“Way to small for me and I bought the largest size.I am an average size woman and found this extremely uncomfortable. it is very tight does not really stretch as advertised and certainly did not provide warmth ,I am not sure that the magnets work at all I have tried wearing it several times but have given up now because it is just so uncomfortable to wear”,1
“Max Factor is my favourite foundation and I have been using these compacts for a few years now. It is very quick and easy to apply. Gives good coverage while looking natural. The compact lasts for months. I will carry on using this product for many more years.”,1
“This took a while to arrive as I did not realise it was coming from china when I bought it, but I am happy with it as it does what it is supposed to do,it is very good when the grand children sleep over as they can go to the bathroom without having to turn the main light on.”,1
“I bought these to help with joint problems , to early to tell yet but I have confidence in them as I have used a few years ago”,1
“Bought these for my grandaughter they have not been worn yet but the fit is good and they are very well made and I am sure they will last untill she outgrows them.”,1
“Fantastic flour I recently bought a Panasonic bread machine and I have not had a bad loaf yet I have used different makes of flour but I think this is going to be my favourite.”,1
“I have used these strips all around the house , they are so easy to use, so much easier than using nails or screws for hanging pictures”,1
“Good quality car charger .I needed this as I have a car dashcam and mobile phone to charge on long trips ,I have only had the need to use it a couple of times and I am very happy with it.”,1
“I love these hooks I always get some spares when they are on offer I have them in various sizes, as I use them all around the house.no more drilling holes and bothering with screws and wall plugs etc. these adhesive hooks are so easy to put up and take down as required , fantastic for hanging pictures and in my large cupboard under the stairs I use them for hanging coats,bags ,walking sticks and other assorted items.”,1
"They are good dependable batteries always last longer than other brands in my opinion.",1
"They were delivered quiclky and well packed",1
